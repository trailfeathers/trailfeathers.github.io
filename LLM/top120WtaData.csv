Climbing almost the entire way, the trek can be tiring, but don’t let this discourage you. The views are well worth it. If you're snowshoeing, make sure to practice good trail manners and stay to the right side of the road, out of the ski tracks. From the lower Sno-Park trailhead, start up the road, continuing straight through the first junction in under a half mile. Pass the middle parking area at 1.2 miles and the upper park at 1.9 miles. After passing over Catt Creek, you’ll come to a string of switchbacks. Keep straight at the junction, then reach a low saddle at 2.6 miles. Here, the road veers right, where you can continue up to High Hut — closer, but a steeper hike. Turning left, you'll enjoy a somewhat flatter grade for a short while. Look for peek-a-boo views of Mount Rainier to your left, until the trail begins climbing again. You'll have another 0.8 mile of steep uphill before this section peaks beneath a banner of prayer flags strung up across the trail. From this colorful indicator, continue on through more forest on a flat grade that begins descending downhill to a junction with the road leading to The Yurt — the furthest flung hut on the system. Stay to the right, and begin the final moderate uphill jaunt, just 0.25 miles to Bruni's. Hike Description Written by Anna Roth , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"A rare set of conditions came together over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, when a strong geomagnetic storm coincided with clear skies in Western Washington. The Bruni Snow Bowl hut offered a dark-sky view to the north, was a reasonable drive from Seattle, and had a hike doable in winter conditions and late in the day. That a warm hut with open reservations was available to wait indoors, patiently for aurora conditions, was an amazing bonus. I started my hike near sunset from the upper sno-park, which @adventurelover noted on Jan 13th was clear. I encountered a bat, entranced by my headlamp, on the hike in, but otherwise the walking was straightforward. Wearing a lightweight mountaineering boot, I did not need microspikes. The forest road was a mix of snow, compacted snow, and gravel. It was certainly not in shape for skiing or snowshoeing. I arrived at the hut in darkness to find myself the sole human occupant, with an owl resting on a perch in the eaves, even though 4 others had made overnight reservations. Having watched the YouTube instructional video, I found the lighting, heat, water filtration, and cooking easy to operate. The hut has a few pairs of rubber boots, and I was lucky to find a pair for my women's size 7 feet to wear outside and to the outhouse, which is very well stocked and kept smelling fresh, thanks presumably to the ski patrol. I made dinner and tea and waited on the deck until 2 am for the aurora to show, only to see a faint green glimmer. I chose a bunk bed upstairs with a northeast view to keep watch in between naps. Around 4:30 am, I awoke to a bright white and pink display of vertical columns of aurora, with green stripes dancing below. Unmistakably an aurora, I ran outside in my warmest layers, captured photographs, and walked around the plateau until sunrise. Having the hut to come in and out of was perfect for cold-weather star- and aurora-gazing, though it was a last-minute plan based more on my familiarity with the hut system trails: I got very lucky. I spent the morning at the gazebo, reading about the Tahoma Trails community and their love of the mountains. It's a wonderful hut and trail system that I feel lucky to have in my backyard. I tried to leave the hut in better shape than I found it and hope it will be enjoyed by many.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial 50 feet of trail is both the Twisp Pass and the North Creek trails. Turn right at the junction just past the trailhead to follow the North Creek trail, which has a couple of long switchbacks in the patchwork of burnt forest in the first stages of natural reforestation — many new seedlings. At 0.9 mile, the trail rounds the ridge and enters the fire-devastated lower North Creek valley. Almost all the trees were killed in the fire, opening up views down to the creek and across the valley. The early summer flowers provide a bright color contrast to the black, brown & gray of the burnt forest. In summer, this will be a hot, shadeless mile of hiking across avalanche and scree slopes, with no access to North Creek. The edge of the near-continuous burn area ends at 1.9 miles, providing welcome shade on sunny days.  The next half-mile is a mix of old forest and spot-fire affected areas. Once in the open, west of Abernathy Peak, the trail is out of the fire zone. The views back down valley include Reynolds Peak in the Sawtooths (look back when you reach the 6-foot boulder by the trail at 2.4 miles). After the short section in the open, the trail returns to the trees. At the North Creek crossing, there are camps on either side of the creek. The permanent bridge is long gone, so a set of four logs, each about 6 inches in diameter form the 8-foot long bridge over the creek. Trekking poles are helpful, since the logs are somewhat springy and slick. In early summer, the logs are underwater and hikers can use the horse ford to get across the creek. After the crossing, the trail quality degrades to a partial streambed (large loose rocks in a broad trough) in places. Between the streambed section and North Lake the trail quality is generally good, with lots of culverts and turnpikes. At 3.7 miles is the junction with Cedar Creek Trail (to Abernathy Pass and on out to the Cedar Creek trailhead).  Nearby is a Chelan National Forest sign mostly enveloped by tree growth. The sign has been there for at least 60 years, since the forest name changed to Okanogan National Forest in 1955. At the head of a meadow, the trail cross a stream above the tarn at 5700 feet, before starting the last push up to the lake. The down valley view includes the Abernathy Pass area on the ridge to the north. The trail descends to the lake just west of the outlet, where there are camps. Another camp is along a trail to the west of the lake (before the inlet). Lastly, there is a small camp near the tarn above and south of the lake. An abandoned trail at about 4.9 miles leads to mine sites 600 to 800 feet above the lake, that also have broader views of the North Creek valley. WTA worked here in 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2020!

There are two starting points. One is near the entrance to Cape Disappointment State Park. The round trip from this trailhead to the lighthouse is 2.4 miles with a 500-foot elevation gain. The other is at the end of Cape D Road. The round trip from this trailhead to the lighthouse is 1 mile with 150 feet elevation gain. From entrance trailhead This is a description of the longer hike. The trailhead is on the left side of the road immediately after the park entrance. The parking lot is straight ahead. There are restrooms near the parking lot. From the parking lot, walk on a paved walkway back to the trailhead. There is a trail map at the trailhead. You immediately start climbing up through a forest. The dirt (and probably muddy) path winds up and down an undulating hill and ends at Lewis & Clark Interpretive Center (LCIC) at 0.6 miles from the trailhead. The entrance fee to this center is $5 as of 2023. Access to the restrooms and the gift shop is free. Walking on the viewing deck on the right side of LCIC, you will see Cape Disappointment Lighthouse perched on the edge of a cliff ahead and vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Going around LCIC you will see a sign for the continuation of Cape Disappointment Trail. You will hike downhill to a low saddle, where a side trail to the right leads to a beach, ominously named Deadman’s Cove. It requires a bit of a scramble to get down to and should only be accessed by those who are comfortable with the steep terrain. But the reward for your effort is beautiful and unique scenery. There is an islet in the cove that was featured on the cover of Life magazine in July 2005. After enjoying the picturesque scenery of Deadman’s Cove, go back up to the main trail. Now a sign directs you to a paved service road to the lighthouse because the last section of the Cape Disappointment trail is shared with the service road from the Coast Guard compound. At the end of the service road is Cape Disappointment Lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse in the Pacific Northwest. The lighthouse is still active, so you may see Coast Guard staff inside or on the road. Leave them to their work as you poke around the lighthouse, The view from the lighthouse is spectacular. Snap a couple of photos and return the way you came. From Cape D Road trailhead Head east leaving the parking area on a rolling trail through ferns, salal and evergreens dripping moss (and likely mist). In just a few hundred feet, come to the junction down to Deadman's Cove. From here, continue straight and follow the directions above to make your way to the lighthouse. WTA Pro Tip: Home to several trails, campsites, cabins for rent and two lighthouses, Cape Disappointment also boasts a visitor center highlighting the journey of the Corps of Discovery — Lewis and Clark’s journey from Missouri to the mouth of the mighty Columbia. If you have time after your hike, make a stop here to round out your visit — it’s located just up the hill from the parking area for the Cape Disappointment Lighthouse.

We went to the original one first and it looks like it’s feeling its age. The North one is much more impressive IMO. Dead Man’s Cove is a non issue; looks like they’ve created another way down that is not as difficult as the original.

For your efforts, you’re rewarded with expansive, ever-changing views of one of the world’s most dynamic landscapes. From the parking lot for Windy Ridge, hike around the closed gate and up a service road. Though gated, the road may still have traffic; scientists and monument staff have access to it, so do be aware of the possibility of vehicles. Views start immediately, with Mount Adams on the horizon to your left and St. Helens peeking around the ridge to your right. An unnamed, craggy edifice to the southeast is worth a few photos as well – the red rock and greenery growing atop it is reminiscent of Jurassic Park. After 1.7 miles of this service road, you’ll arrive at a fork. Signed for the Abraham Trail, take the left-hand ridgetop route. With sheer drop-offs on either side and makeshift stepladders to hold the trail in place, it’s hard to believe that bikes are also allowed here. Wheeze your way to the top of those ladders, and reward yourself with a breathtaking view of Mounts Rainier and Adams, the Dark Divide, and the Mount Margaret Backcountry. You’re 2.2 miles into your hike, just shy of your highest point on this side of the loop, but these are the best views. Continue uphill and at 4750 feet, the trail appears to fork. Your route is to the left, away from the blast zone and through a small grove of alder and descending gradually. As the trail wraps around the flanks of the hillside, admire the flower show: lupine, penstemon, paintbrush – the usual suspects are here on gorgeous display. The trail drops to the Smith Creek drainage. Cross it, and head roughly south towards a junction with the Plains of Abraham. At this junction, you’re four miles from Windy Ridge, and have a totally new perspective on the mountain. The rock and snow blend dramatically with the flat plains ahead of you, and a rainbow of rock colors hide in the landscape. Look also for the lupine and penstemon carpeting the ground in front of you. From this junction, turn right onto the Loowit Trail. At first easy to follow, the way becomes more difficult, necessitating some routefinding, particularly to reach Windy Pass, which is to your left, marked by a solitary pole. It’s worth mentioning that the climb to the pass can be difficult, since the trail here washes out frequently. Use caution and common sense when attempting it. If it is just too dicey, turn around. The views are just as good on the way back. If you make it into the pass, take a minute to soak in the views of the pumice plain and Spirit Lake, before descending on switchbacks into your first of many lahar crossings. It’s another mile from the pass to the junction with Windy Trail (making for a total of 2.5 miles from the Plains of Abraham junction). At the Windy Trail junction, hang a right and begin descending, following those tall poles into the open basin where the service road ends. Return to your car via the service road, stopping to enjoy the views along the way. WTA Pro Tip: If you’re hankering for more of this incredible landscape, extend your hike from the Windy Trail junction to Loowit Falls. It’s 3.2 miles roundtrip from the Windy Trail junction to a view of a stunning waterfall fed by the Crescent Glacier. Hike Description Written by Anna Roth , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"Forest road 25 and 99 from Randle to the trailhead are in rough shape with many slumps and sinkholes that are not fun to hit going over 20mph. Some also force traffic to leave the outer lane and could result in a head on collision. The 25 road south of Elk Pass is closed for several miles due to the washout. People are bypassing the barriers but is still closed to vehicular travel. An alternate route is the 28 road. It is a gravel road that is in fairly good condition. Also watch out for logging trucks and semis hauling supplies for the road construction on the pumice plain. During the week, there is also a lot of dump truck traffic from the Cascade Peaks turn to the trailhead. The contractors are using about 2/3rds of the trailhead as a staging area so there is limited parking. Road construction has reached 1 mile beyond the researcher lot. They are about 1/3rd of a mile from the 1st large creek. The road has large rock surfacing up to the 2nd small bridge. The freshly ripped up section is very lumpy with soft soil. My understanding is that in the fall many of the creek crossings will be removed to storm proof the road until the spring. Here is more info about the road. https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/giffordpinchot/?project=51305 The road is being built to support this project to improve the condition of the outlet tunnel and investigate the debris dam: https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/giffordpinchot/?project=57259 The ""Spirit Lake Outflow Safety Improvement Project"" is now in scoping and there will continue to be public meetings. https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/giffordpinchot/?project=66482",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Parking lot was starting to fill up on the edges but nothing in the middle until I left. Bathrooms were clean but not stocked. Since my last trip up which was about two weeks ago there is much more snow. Now snow covers the road from the parking area all the way up. At the top there is much more snow coverage and you are less likely to hit a rock. I used snowshoes but saw people going in just boots but there was a lot of post holes in the snow when I was heading down. The snow was light and fluffy and perfect for snowshoes. Majority of people out were skiers/snowboarders. At one point I counted over 20 skiers heading up behind me. It was fairly busy up at Artist point but nobody was at Huntoon when I was there. Lots of dogs and like 95% were off leash. This also meant fresh turds to navigate but only a few.,,,,"5,200 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Huntoon Point Snowshoe With a starting elevation of 4,300, this tour is your best guarantee of good snow, even in a lean year. The sojourn to Huntoon Point is a study in contrasts. It starts amid the hustle and bustle of the Mount Baker Ski Area and ends in the silence of Kulshan Ridge, where icy winds blowing off glaciers will cleanse your soul and refresh your spirit. Park at the enormous lot adjoining the upper lodge of the ski area (4,300 feet) and head up from the southeast corner of the lot. The route is straightforward, but not without some minor huffing and puffing. You’ll be swimming against the current of downhill skiers and snowboarders, but the snow-covered high meadows will compensate for the traffic. Take the obvious trail that veers off to the right from a downhill run, climb a steep hill and catch your breath at Austin Pass with its spectacular view of Mount Shuksan. Follow the path of the summer road as it traverses beneath a ridge, and then angle up before you come to the last big switchback below Kulshan Ridge (Artist Point). This switchback has seen slides and is the only dicey place on the route, so exercise caution. One more episode of vociferous grunting and you’re on top. Head southeast along the undulating ridge to the high spot at Huntoon Point, where basking in the winter sun can be a religious experience. From the Point, the North Cascades reveal themselves in a most breathtaking fashion. Mount Shuksan is resplendent and the Border Peaks form a magnificent chorus line against the northern horizon. Mt. Baker, the Great White Watcher, dominates all. Don’t hurry back down; linger awhile, eat your lunch and savor the remarkable view.

Trailhead was icy. 55 cars at the trailhead when I left at 3:15. If you hike with a dog, don't forget that the Forest Service requires dogs to be on a leash in developed areas which includes trailheads. Toilet: Stocked with toilet paper. Only a few items of trash left behind by people who were unwilling to pack it out. There is no trash service at this trailhead right now, so the Forest Service is not currently requiring a pass at this trailhead. Lots of dog poop left along the highway route up. Ick. Trail/Route: You can take the highway grade which is 2.7 miles to Artist Point, or the Wild Goose trail route which is about 1.7 mile.  The road was very easy walking. No spikes or snowshoes needed. The trail was more compact than yesterday and there was a solid snowshoe/boot/ski track going up. There are a few braided trails, but they all seemed to rejoin eventually.  I took the trail up and wore spikes the whole way to Artist Point, but they weren't necessary for the upper section of the trail. When I got to Artist Point I put on snowshoes for the trip out Artist Ridge to Huntoon Point. There was a solid track out there too, and I saw a few people in just boots who were doing fine. I took the highway back since it was more in the sun, and was glad since there are some really nice icicles between Terminal Lake and the Lake Ann Trailhead that you don't see from the Wild Goose Trail. Safety: There still isn't enough snow for a large avalanche, but I did see some roller balls, some new rockfall, and a small slide that happened in the past couple of days. All of these were in locations that were under steep rocky areas and are the same locations that become the avalanche terrain when there is more snow. This is a great time of year to look for an avalanche safety course from the Northwest Avalanche Center (free!) if you haven't had one yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The big reason I came here is I was visiting family member graduating from college in Spokane Valley. There is a small trail from the cave to the Canadian Border to checkout ""The Slash"" which is name of the section of trees that are clear cut between the United States and Canada for some 5,000 miles or so from Maine to Alaska. This trail is only about a 1/4 mile long up to the border. There is a picnic table at the end. This report is really about Gardner Cave which is what I did while there. This is a guided tour that you must make reservations online unless you get there and there is room. The cave maintains a 39 degrees year round so have a jacket. Times are 10:00 12:00 2:00 and 4:00. 12:00 is the one that will likely have kids on it. No food or beverages of any kind are allowed to include water. Cameras are fine. There is a water faucet you can use if thirsty right next to the cave. There is a small but short climb up the trail to the cave. This cave is not very big so the tour is very short. The Ranger(Geologist) that spoke on our tour was very knowledgeable on the cave and made the tour enjoyable. Checkout the video of this hike below by click on the link or go to my vimeo channel https://vimeo.com/user81914660 and checkout over 420 hikes I have done in several states and countries. Hint: I would suggest if going here  to get your best bang for your buck and find something else to see nearby. There are several short hikes to waterfalls and dams along the way that maybe worth seeing to add to the enjoyment. Mount Spokane is one of them with many trails. The weather was lighting and raining on top so I did not try it. Other trails nearby are Flume Creek Trail, Abercrombie Trail, Abercrombie Mountain, Section of the Pacific Northwest Trail and Riverside Canyon Overlook. BEWARE: This is Grizzly Country up near the Canadian Border and in Idaho and you are only ten miles straight from Idaho. Please carry bear spray and try to hike with someone if possible. Grizzlys have been reported in North Eastern Washington. We are also introducing Grizzly back into the North Cascades of Washington at about ten per year for the next ten years so be aware of this for the future. Having hiked extensive in Alberta Canadian and talk to people there the best thing is bear spray for a detert but only if its in the ready to fire position and most people attacked had it in their backpack and that serves no purpose.

In 1899, homesteader Ed Gardner’s horse stumbled into the sinkhole that now marks the entrance to his namesake cave. Legend has it that Gardner used the cave as his base for a bootlegging business, until a streak of bad luck at poker resulted in the loss of his deed to William Crawford, who ultimately signed the property over to Washington State Parks. The geologic history of the cave is far older, of course. About 500 million years ago, the site was ocean floor. The shells of dead sea creatures decomposed into an ooze that would eventually become limestone. The uplift of the Selkirk Mountains caused the limestone sediment to fold and crack. Later, as water seeped and dripped into the cavern through the calcium-rich limestone, an array of deposit formations began growing into unique and interesting cave features. Stalactites, like icicles, cling to the cave roof. Stalagmites build from the cave floor up. Where the two meet, a column is formed. The 7.8-ton Gardner Cave column is the largest in the Pacific Northwest. Human imagination has led to the naming of several other formations: the Frozen Waterfall, Christmas Tree (dated to 90,000 years), Roast Turkey, Lopsided Wedding Cake, Queen’s Throne and the Frog. Cave Tours Tours are offered every Thursday through Monday at 10 a.m., 12 noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., from May through mid-September. A Discover Pass required to park, but the tours themselves are free. You need to schedule ahead of time though! Call the park at 509-238-4258 Wear a jacket, as the cave is a constant 41 to 43 degrees. Never touch the cave walls, as this causes irreparable damage to calcite growth.

You'd have to have the same level of endurance as Kelvin Kiptum to call this an easy climb. Anyway, we hit the trail at around 8 am. You should probably start earlier if you want to make it down in time to have bratwursts in Leavenworth before they close. We took a lot of breaks so we got down pretty late around 7 pm. Road up to the trailhead was fine, a few rough spots but my suv handled it pretty well. Honestly, you'd probably be ok even if you brought a Honda Civic, just be careful. (we saw a Tesla which makes me think any low clearance can make it) The trail was super cool and Colchuck lake was unlike anything ive ever seen in my 15 years of living in Washington. It kind of reminded me of Diablo lake the way the blue water looked like Mr Clean all purpose cleaner. We couldn't stick around though and we made our way to Asgard pass. This was the most grueling part of the hike. The previous trip report was absolutely correct about the terrible footing going up Asgard pass. The trail was basically made out of powdered chalk and each step would kick up a mouthful of dust. I ended up climbing on the rocks next to the path which was tiring but at least I wasn't slipping every step that I took. After Asgard pass was the highlighted danger of the route that I want to warn you about. The Snowfield. Or I should say the ice field because halfway through it looks like Frozone projected black ice from his hands onto the side of the mountain. There were two other parties on the way down that had glum faces and told us they had to turn around because of the bad snow conditions. I thought I was special for some reason and decided to check it out myself. Sure enough my ego took me too far and found myself on a steep sheet of ice covered in slushy snow. Not even my crampons or Ice Axe gave me confidence to climb this. As much as I wanted to keep going, I decided my life wasn't worth climbing a 8000 foot mountain so I turned around. Oh well, I'll get redemption next year. If you dedicate your heart to climbing this mountain, there's definitely a way you could get around this sketchy part. All in all, it was about 13 miles round trip and took us 11 hours.

Climbing gear and expertise required.,,,,,,,,Did Dragontail yesterday via the snow/ice patch. It is quite the haul getting up there for a car 2 car. We made 1 step on the ice and were able to climb around it on scree. We used our crampons and ice axes for the ice and then removed them below the scramble and left them below the 3rd/4th class section. We scrambled up and summited. Well.. it started snowing and raining on the summit and we weren't comfortable making the 4th class moves on wet rock. So we made the call not to wait it out for the rock to dry and ditched our ice axes and crampons at the base of the climb where we left them :( We ended up going back via the class 2 route around south east dragontail and down towards witches tower (which is a wayyyy better route) and back to the pass and out.

I hiked Gobblers Knob in 2023 and had no idea there were more trails up there. When I saw that they cleared the landslide, I knew I had to go up before the road closed for winter. I had thought about biking to the terminus and hike up the North Puyallup Trail. However, after hiking up to Gobbler’s Knob trailhead and then realizing I was headed downhill to the bike back up hill, I opted to park the bike at the South Puyallup Trail and hike from there. South Puyallup trail was in great shape and there were tons of berries along it. At the camp, I crossed the river (very nice bridge with great river views) and hiked up the Wonderland trail to St Andrews Park. Near the peak, I saw a group of grouses in the field. They were jumping around and foraging for food. I also heard and saw a number of pikas on the rocks. As I rounded a bend in the trail, I came across a young bear eating his way up the trail. He and I were both surprised to see each other! He just wanted to eat all the berries without anyone bothering him. I waited a few minutes for him to climb up the hillside before I made my way down. The views at St Andrews Lake were beautiful, but I decided to take a break at Aurora Lake to determine how to get back to my bike. I opted to continue along the Wonderland trail and go back down the North Puyallup Trail and walk down Westside road (4 miles) to get back to my bike. The trail down from Aurora Lake to North Puyallup appeared to have been hit by landslides/storms, but I could see evidence of recent work crew work (thank you!). I took it slow since the rocks were wet and it was muddy. When I got to the intersection of Wonderland at North Puyallup trail, I had no idea that there were multiple old bridges there, and even it looked like an old car park. It was so cool to see. I was very called I opted to hike along this trail. The North Puyallup Trail was a bit overgrown in places, but very manageable to hike through and very clear to see the old rock wall built along the sides. When I got back to the trailhead, I saw a ranger work group (they must have down all the recent work). I walked the 4 miles back to my bike (took a detour to Denman Falls), and then biked about 5 miles back to the car. Overall, 15.5 hiking miles and 10 bike miles. #HiketheState",,,,"6,750 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Wonderland Trail The Wonderland Trail is a 93-mile hiking trail that encircles Washington's most famous volcano. Each year, hikers vie for permits to embark on a backpacking trip on it, with only a handful scoring the permits to undertake this strenuous hike. While it's arguably one of the most gorgeous trails in Washington, it's also one of the most challenging, with lots of elevation gain and loss as hikers climb in and out of lahars, up onto ridges, and on the flanks of Mount Rainier. The best way to be prepared for this hike is to do plenty of research, have a good understanding of your hiking skills and abilities, and create a specific, day-by-day itinerary for your hike. Get started here, and when you have your hike planned, apply for your permits by either faxing or mailing them to Mount Rainier. WTA worked here in 2025, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012!",,,,,,,,"15.5-miles/3000-feet elevation gain. So happy to see the Rainier summit whitewashed in a fresh coat of paint. The Wonderland Trail is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate. Today I encountered two new show-stoppers:the log footbridge over the Nisqually River at Cougar Rock washed out a few days ago (at least I wasn't on it at the time!). This prohibits access along the WT/Carter Falls trail heading east. I pivoted my plan and back-tracked the WT to the Ramparts, heading north towards Pyramid Creek Camp, but...the WT disappeared into Kautz Creek about half a mile south of PCC. Later in the day I met some hikers that showed me on their map App where the WT had been significantly rerouted to cross the creek further upstream. I found no cairns or trail indicators and so turned around, reengaging the Rampart Ridge trail for a fun, fast 5K descent back to Longmire. Still hungry for more and harboring FOMO from impending snowfall at lower elevations, I crossed the Nisqually Suspension Bridge and did a loop around the Longmire Campground - wonderfully deserted and serene this time of year. Intersected the Eagle Peak trail and started the arduous ascent to see if my App was correctly showing snow depth. Only went up about a quarter mile before I met the hikers coming down from the peak. They confirmed encountering about 2-3"" of snow cover at the top of Eagle Peak. By then I had logged 14-miles and 3000-feet elevation gain and fatigue was making me hangry so I turned and headed back to Longmire. In addition to the Wonderland Trail dead ends I encountered we have the indefinite closure of the Fairfax Bridge, which significantly impacts logistics associated with the Wonderland Trail in the NW corner of the park. What's next?! Todays trail time provided perspective and confirmation on why it's so important to chase goals and passions - now. ""One of these days I'll do it"" is just unpredictable false hope. I'm grateful that six years ago I took advantage of an opportunity to circumnavigate Mount Rainier by running the 93-mile Wonderland Trail with a group.

We got started at 8am and took the Dungeness trail for about a mile, before taking a right before the foot bridge on the Royal Basin trail. After a very short bit we took a right on the Maynard Burn Trail. The hike up this point was quite mellow with the grade, but once on the Maynard Trail it changed and got steep. Once on the Upper Maynard trail, which is an old abandoned road, the grade lessens. At the end of this begins the Baldy Trail. This thing is quite steep. Kind of like Cable Line, except it’s 3000 feet straight up instead of only 2000 ft up. Once on the ridge, we took a left and went up to East Baldy. Here we had to drop down about 200ft before heading up to the summit of Baldy. While up at the summit the fog started to roll in, and started to block our view. We did get some excellent views before this, and while on the summit we saw a climber up on the summit of Gray Wolf Peak. On the way back we decided to do the ridge traverse over to Tyler Peak. This went well, as it traverses over some beautiful terrain  to get over to Tyler summit. There is a trail all the way. On the way back to the Tyler Peak trail which we were going to take down, we followed a climbers path, and went up to the summit of Peak B. This peak is very rugged, but the path went all the way up to the summit on the back side. No views from here, as we were now in the fog. Once back down from Peak B, we took the trail down all the way down to the trailhead at the upper road. This trail is very nice, as it heads up the mega steep slope with many small switchbacks. It doesn’t mess around, and will get you up and down fast. From the trailhead we took a trail that would lead us to the Lower Maynard Burn trail. Once on the Lower trail, we looked and found a faint trail, which we took straight down. It faded out , but then we found a nice game trail which took us down to the Dungeness Trail about a 1/5 mile from the trailhead.

They recently opened the road about a week ago after lying new gravel over it. The road is amazing now and passable with basically any vehicle. We didn't see a single person on the trail across both days, but there were two other cars at the parking lot. It started snowing a bit during our summit and there was a light layer of snow, but we didn't need micro spikes or crampons. A ton of rain came down as we were heading home though so I'm guessing it got another inch or two of snow up there. The larches are in prime color higher up, while some of the ones lower down are still a bit yellow. We came in via phelps creek, the streams were easy to cross but there was still water in case you need to refill. Going up into leeroy basin was steep but when you get there it's beautiful. We ate lunch there and headed out towards freezer pass. Freezer pass is also steep and you need to be a bit careful with footing for the last part but otherwise it's not too bad, no scramble or anything. We then hiked down to upper ice lake where we set up camp on a small hill with wind protection. The sky was clear and you could see the milky way perfectly at night. In the morning we packed up and  headed towards the summit trail where we left most of our stuff under a tarp. Getting to the summit isn't bad, you never have to use your hands and it's just a steep hike up. There's one section right before you get onto the ridge that's a bit steep and was slippery with some snow on the way down though. On top of the ridge it was extremely windy, with gusts near 30-40mph easily. The summit was super windy so we didn't spend much time up there, but there's a bright yellow summit register under a rock, last entry was from 3 months ago before the fire closure. We then headed back down and grabbed our stuff, where we took the carne high route trail out. The last part of going down freezer pass was a bit hard, as it goes down into a short gulley. Afterwards, stay high up and traverse over to the saddle. This short section to the saddle was a bit hard to follow, but it gets much better afterwards.  Box creek is pretty dried up right now but there's still a couple places to fill water along the way to carne mountain. Down from carne is pretty slow and hard on the knees but I would much rather go down the carne high route than the phelps creek trail. The carne high route was gorgeous and I 100% recommend going out that way if you are considering it. This was probably the best fall hike I've ever done, and if you find the right window before the heavy snow and while the larches are prime, it is absolutely incredible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Carne Mountain High Route,,,,,,,,"Look, when you’re built different, an alpine route isn’t a challenge; it’s an opportunity to humble the general population. We rolled out of Leavenworth at a ridiculous hour, still battling the effects of a mandatory post-gain celebration, which definitely involved dominating the Oktoberfest scene the night before, but duty calls. It was way too early for the kind of vertical we were about to crush, but we showed up. Immediately, we saw the problem: a huge bottleneck of tourists, probably 20+ of them , all looking overwhelmed just tying their boots. As we cruised past, the four of us (Chad, Brad, Brock, and Trent) made sure to subtly flex our arms —you know, just to provide a little motivation for the slow-pokes to try harder. Been telling Trent to lay off the trenbolone, but he's been making huge gains lately! The initial ascent up the Carne Mountain Trail? That was strictly a hangover burn session. We absolutely annihilated that vertical mile, putting so much distance on the tourists behind us that they probably thought we used a helicopter. After the chemical carnage of the night before, that speed was a PR, no cap. We hit the Carne Basin camp area, which is supposedly where the ""views"" start. We saw our first larches. I mean, they were yellow, I guess? They were alright. Seriously, the Icicle Gorge Trail loop has way cooler lighting for a post-workout photoshoot. It's like, okay, trees, we get it. Focus on the gains. The real fun started when we linked up with the actual High Route. We hit the snow. The snow itself wasn't the problem—the terrain was just fine for our superior traction (i.e., our quads). The real challenge was the constant, annoying, on-and-off slippery snow and rocky sections , which forced us to constantly transition between wearing our microspikes and ripping them off. It completely interrupted the flow state. The only thing challenging was the gear management. Glacier Peak views? Totally obscured. Whatever. We car-to-carred that thing last summer. Old news. After a lot of traversing, we finally made it over the larchy passes. This was the spiritual and caloric low point, so the Squad called an audible. We collectively crushed a four-pack of White Monster Energy drinks. We needed that taurine and energy rush to get rowdy and finish the send. It worked. We were absolutely buzzing. The final technical section —the one where falling ""would not be ideal"". It was hella slip-and-slide. Brad was being a dunce and almost slipped off the mountainside. The scramble gullies up to Freezer Pass were mostly clear, which was great for demonstrating raw power over finesse. The final steep section had some powder snow, which just meant we got an extra killer burn in the glutes from the challenging traction. We basically climbed that section using pure hatred and protein. Don't fall! We made it to Freezer Pass, and yeah, it was snow covered and ""beautiful,"" but the wind was absolutely disrespectful. It was messing up our hair and making it impossible to get a solid, shirtless pump-check photo, so we bailed quick. Gains must be protected. The descent was another one of those supposedly ""challenging"" sections of snow. We ran it anyway. The only challenge was trying to maintain a heart rate high enough to count as real cardio while simultaneously not crushing our shins. Once we dropped into Leroy Creek Basin, the snow finally cleared up. We took a lightning-fast snack break (BCAAs only, no time for real food), transitioned to full running, and absolutely smashed the quick time back down to the valley. The rain and snow finally decided to catch up with us at the end, which was fine, because that just meant it was time for the final sprint. We ran out the valley trail straight to the finish line: the Jeep Gladiator , which was already packed full of ice-cold brewskis. Conclusion: Carne High Route is a solid warm-up hike. 6/10 for scenery, 10/10 for the workout. The boys and I went to Icicle Gorge afterwards for some real scenery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hiked up/over Longs Pass Saturday afternoon, camped at Ingells Creek that night. Plenty of running water in Ingells creek, but that’s the only water we saw. The trail is otherwise completely dry and also snow-free. Started hiking up the couloir 4:15am. There are several possible entry points into the couloir, we chose one my partner had used previously but it was overgrown and hard to navigate. The one we used on the descent (closer to the entrance to the valley) was in much better shape. Gained 2500 ft elevation before the sun really hit the couloir and started baking the route. the couloir is generally easy to navigate, with cairns all over and trail that’s more obvious from above, but a lot of what we did for the ascent could generously be called Interpretive. We relied on a pre-downloaded gps map (garmin worked well) to keep us on route. We also wore helmets and dirt-gaiters, which helped a lot with the loose dirt, rocks, and debris getting knocked down. Saw several car-to-car folks on the route, and people coming down the couloir from the West Ridge. The last 400ft vertical gain, the summit push, is where the real fun is. If you like scrambling over 4th and a handful of 5th class moves (depending on your interpretation of the route. Again, gps was necessary to stay on track), then you’ll love the top of Stuart! If you’re not comfortable with those sort of moves, as my partner isn’t, you’ll move very slowly. There are also LOTS of bivy sites up here with well made wind walls and ledges. Arrived at the summit 10am. Signed the register and slowly made our way down the couloir. My partner has less experience on choss and this level of loose dirt and so moved very tentatively. The sun baked the entire descent, so finding shade for breaks was necessary. Back to camp 3pm, broke camp, and hiked back up and over Longs Pass to the car. Afternoon shade on the Stuart-side of longs pass, thankfully. Back to the car 6:20pm.",,,,"9,416 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Mount Stuart Mount Stuart is a popular climb in the Enchantments area of Washington State. Have gear and climbing expertise before you attempt this.,,,,,,,,"Route taken: Cascadian couloir Distance (RT): 12.0mi/19.3km Gain: 7576ft/2309m Total Time (moving): 9:20hr Type: Solo Gear (used): Semi-rigid mountaineering boots, poles, helmet, gloves Gear (unused): N/A Gear (should have brought): N/A (consider dirt gaiters for standard hiking/trail running shoes) Water: Abundant at Ingall's Creek. No snow on route. Used ~2.5L from camp to summit and back. Bugs: Moderate at camp directly near creek, but not bothersome. None at peak Overnight at Ingall's Creek via Long's Pass (~2hr to reach from TH). Quiet at camp; only a handful of tents spotted. Setup at the soft, sandy spot next to the creek. Left 05:30am. There are multiple branches to reach the col from Ingall's Creek trail as you head right (east) from camp. I took the first entry point left ~50-100yds down. Good boot path and no bushwack sections. A few blowdowns but nothing significant. The trail will end at the col. I used the track on Gaia to follow, but you can effectively create your own route. There is a slight, switchbacked path marked with cairns that is easy to follow as well. This first section is extremely sandy and slippery. While not burdensome, it became significantly so on the descent. Once near the top of the col, stay left and head towards the western ridge. I presume this is where the snowfield normally resides that I have read about (and advised to keep left) - but there was no snow present at this time. - You will also see a notch/opening at the top of the col that leads out to the north side of the mountain. This is not where you want to go but worth venturing to for the view - Once you climb over the ridge towards the west face, you will see the summit and scramble route. I maintained high on the ridge and quickly got into some class 4/5 moves. However if you drop down (further than expected) directly from the ridge, you will notice a faint booth path and an abundance of cairns leading the way. You will then have some good class 3 (or 4/5 if you wish) scrambling, but otherwise straight-forward with no significant concern. Approx 3h20min to reach summit from camp. Had entire route +2hr on the summit to myself before leaving (and still no one present until I reached the ridge/col). Great views esp of Sloan and Glacier Peak. The height of Stuart really allows one to gain spatial awareness of all the mountains and regions and their aspects to each other. One error made was descending too quickly - thinking I knew the route - without referencing the GPS track at proper intervals once back over the ridge. I veered too far east and mistakenly entered the adjacent col, quickly finding myself on steep, sloping, sandy rock that required significant effort to get back out of. Once back on cascadian col, the remainder of the decent is mostly benign. However significant care needs to be taken with the last 1000ft or so before reaching the trail back to camp. Here, the rock is covered with fine sand and is extremely slippery. This was the most treacherous section of the day for me. ================================================================== Note: Carrying a heavy backpack to camp at Ingall's Creek (+ back up to Long's Pass after summitting) seems a wasted effort in hindsight. Recommendation would be car2car with a lightweight pack and filtering water at the creek vs overnight. ==================================================================",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally speaking the loop was in good condition, with the exception of the last 5ish miles of the Eagle Pass section (before connecting back with the Oval Lakes Trail), which was very brushy at times, with lots of ankle rollers left over from the removal of the downed logs. That being said, kudos to the local trail crew, as this would have been quite brutal without their hard work, yarding out those logs! We found a nice camping spot at West Oval Lake. There are several, with defined paths to each. We also got a chuckle at the sign at the turn off stating 'no stock camping past this point', only to find infrastructure at the lake for tying up horses! The path to the fork of Oval Pass and Middle/East Oval Lakes is a steeper grade but is manageable. Just know that from West Oval Lake to the other two Oval Lakes, you will need to climb approximate 100', and then descend most of that. The views From Gray Peak were also outstanding. The next day we went over Oval Pass to Horseshoe Basin. When you arrive at the hunting camp there is a sign for the wilderness toilet. Follow that trail to get back to the #1259 trail to take you to Stehekin/Eagle Pass.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Eagle Pass,,,,,,,,"Did the loop from Oval Creek, up Oval Pass, down (and then up!) Eagle Pass, and then rejoining the Oval Creek trailhead. The road to the TH is in fine condition, with a few blowdown trees easily navigated around. Larches are solid gold for the higher altitude reaches of the hike, but some of the trees in the lower meadows of the hike (e.g below 7k ft) are still in the process of turning. Temperature was a bit below freezing at night - as witnessed by the slushy nature of the water bottle I left outside my tent overnight- and with the wind/blowing snow, the conditions at Oval Pass were winter-like. Descending from Oval Pass was a bit slow, as a fall would have been both easy and unpleasant.... all that fresh snow compounded with the steep talus of the trail made for unstable footing, but once I hit the treeline it was relatively smooth sailing. I  camped out at the junction with the Summit Trail: the outdoor toilet boasts excellent views, but most of the campsites were a bit soggy. One thing to note: the first few miles of the trail are a bit overgrown, and considering it was sleeting/raining at that altitude, the amount of water from the brush that made it onto my pants/boots was enormous. I wore my waterproof pants on the way back, to avoid having to wring out my socks every 30 minutes. Obviously, there was no one else masochistic to camp out on a Wednesday in these conditions: I didn't see anyone else until I was just about at the trailhead on my way back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which is definitely open, and accessible… What we did do was set out for cussed hollow from the lower Lewis river falls campground, taking forest road 90 back toward northwoods, then on the pepper creek road until its juncture with forest road 93. About four miles past the junction, the road is washed out…there was likely enough space to fit a vehicle with a few feet to spare, but we weren’t feeling great about the risk and ended up doing another hike instead. On the way back, we realized we should have just started this one at crab creek. Highly recommend not going toward Spencer butte for an hour when the alternative starting point is 5 minutes from you. Either way, the hike overview should probably offer both starting points due to this washout, which likely affects Spencer butte and other nearby hikes. Beautiful area, some noise from orv’s but had a fantastic time anyway. Happy trails!",,,,"3,400 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Cussed Hollow Nestled in the forests in the upper Cussed Hollow Valley, this lower elevation hike thaws more quickly than some of the other trails in the area, attracting ground-foraging wildlife such as the forest grouse and their prey. Grouse are present in 34 of Washington’s 39 counties. The western slope of the Cascades is home to the sooty blue grouse. Males have blue-gray feathers, complemented by orange and white accents. Females are smaller and less flashy, mildly decorated with brown and gray coloring. To spot one, tread softly and listen for a “whoomp!” calling sound. Look for areas of disturbed soil and stray feathers where the birds are known for “graveling.” You may not be the only one camping out for grouse-gatherings. The brush offers good coverage for sneaky bobcats, who crouch and watch their prey before pouncing on the chicken-sized birds. While bobcats are reclusive by nature and mostly quiet, when they do make noise, it can be rather upsetting if you don’t know what to expect. A noisy bobcat often sounds like a woman screaming or a baby crying. Ready for some wildlife spotting? Set out on the woodland trail, crossing over and around several tributaries on their way to Cussed Hollow Creek. Steadily descend into Cussed Hollow through western white pine, Douglas fir, and Silver fir trees before turning uphill around 1 mile. Pop out around the ridge at 2.5 miles. This is a good spot to turn back the way you came, straining your ears above the babbling brooks for the calls of the wild. Hike Description Written by Brittany Manwill, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"I've hiked the Lewis River Falls trail before but opted to explore other trails in the area. I started my hike at the crab creek trailhead and went up the bluff trail towards the forest road 93. The bluff trail was a bit overgrown, but still easy to follow. This trail is very steep and do not recommend unless you have poles. I felt like I was climbing straight up! About a mile towards the end of the trail, I encountered snow. It was just a dusting on the trees and trail. I then walked the road towards cussed hollow and Spencer butte trailhead. Originally I had planned to hike up Spe cerButte but as there was snow on the road and it was snowing now, I decided to save that for another day. they looked out trailed, but there was quite a bit of snow. My returnbtrio was down the cussed hollow trail. I can tell that this trail is predominatly used by mountain bike since it was very cambered at parts. The trail is in good shape outside of that. Note that there is a river crossing which looked about calf deep. However,there is a ver large downed tree that easy to use to cross the river. The trail ends at the beginning of the wright meadow trail , which is also seems to be a mountain bike trail which was pretty hard to walk on. I then took the Lewis river trail past the lower falls back to the crab creek trailhead.

I added side trips up to Flower Dome, Sheep Camp, Cloudy Pass, Image Lake and a portion of the Grassy Point trail. I started this hike counter-clockwise in case the Napeequa River was too high to cross. I figured it’s much easier to bail on Day 1 than to come across the River at the end of the trip, especially since the closest bail point, Little Giant Pass, was closed due to the Pomas Fire. The initial hike up the White River Trail to the start of the Boulder Pass Trail is very easy to follow with minimal elevation gain. Boulder Pass was easy to follow with improving views up to the pass, but there is definitely a fair amount of elevation gain. My watch showed over 5,000 feet for the day over 16.5 miles. The descent into Napeequa Valley starts off clear and easy to follow. The second half of the decent becomes much more overgrown with a handful of blowdowns throughout, but the tread was still clear up until you reach the Napeequa River. The Napeequa River was just above my knees and moving somewhat swiftly. For reference, I’m 6’ 2”. I just took it slow, ensuring I had secure footholds in the bottom of the River. Trekking Poles are a life saver here. In the end, the crossing wasn’t too bad. There was some minor route finding to pick up the Napeequa Valley Trail where I crossed the River. Once I picked it up, it was certainly overgrown, but easy to follow. There are stunning Valley Views all the way to the Louis Creek Falls Camp, which sits about a quarter mile before the falls. It’s a small site, good for one, maybe two 1-person tents. It was a great spot, with a clear view of the falls. This was another big day. I clocked in another 5,000+ feet in elevation gain over 13 miles. The trail is more of the same through Napeequa to the start of the climb to High Pass. Overgrown in spots but plenty of tread. The initial climb out of the Valley is steep and overgrown. There’s a lot of elevation gain in a short period from here to High Pass. Eventually you reach an opening that reveals the long way you still have to High Pass, but great views of Clark Mountain and Richardson Glacier back toward Napeequa. From this point on, the trail comes and goes. Some minor route finding is required. Generally follow the water and you’ll pick the trail back up. It’s a bit of a grind to the top, but you’ll be rewarded with great views at the Pass. This is the first good look at Glacier Peak. The descent down High Pass was probably the sketchiest part of the whole trip. The trail was completely snow free but there is a decent sized boulder field to cross. My advice would be to stay on the lower side of the boulder field until you pick the trail back up. Just take it slow and use some caution and you’ll be fine. The rest of the way is mostly down hill with easy and clear trails. I took a side trip to Flower Dome, which personally I would not recommend. Too many trees obstructed any views, so I didn’t think it was worth it. The trail through Buck Creek Pass offers continuous views of Glacier Peak. You’ll reach a forested section leading up the Sheep Camp Trail. The end of the Sheep Camp Trail opens up to stunning views of Glacier Peak, which was a great place to set up camp. The night before, I convinced myself to add a trip to Cloudy Pass for Day 3, which was worth it. The trail out to cloudy pass was easy to follow with some elevation, but it delivered excellent views overlooking the Lyman Lakes Area. I continued to Image Lake and took a couple Classic pictures of Glacier Peak overlooking the Lake. It was becoming overcast, which put a bit of a damper on my pictures but it was still a great view. I spent entirely way too much time talking to someone staying at Image Lake, so I had to book it down Miners Ridge to my planned camp. Of course I could not resist a quick trip to the Miners Ridge Fire Tower, which was fantastic. Some of the best views of the trip. I then proceeded to book it 6 miles down Miners Ridge to where it meets the PCT and made it before nightfall. The hike up to the Grassy Point was fairly uneventful. Easy trail with a decent amount of elevation gain along the PCT. This was a heavily forested section, but it eventually opens up to some really stunning views. I proceeded past the Grassy Point trail a half a mile to get water and then came back. The plan was to go to Grassy Point, but I quickly realized the trail was not going to be easy to follow. I kept losing the trail, but picked it up, except it didn’t come close to the trail on ON X Backcountry. I picked out a high point and made it there. It offered decent enough views of Glacier Peak. I could kind of see a potential path forward, but I still had a long way to go and it was getting late and I was wiped. I set up camp back at a previously used site near the PCT. The trail continues along the PCT through an easy to follow forested section until you descend down to Mill Creek. This area becomes much more overgrown with some trail washouts throughout. The ascent out of Mill creek is much of the same. Some really overgrown sections but a lot more blowdowns to navigate. The trail tread is still clear and easy to follow, but the brush certainly became frustrating at times. Eventually it eases up and you reach an opening with camps at the base of Mica Lake. I continued up to Mica Lake, which provided a lot of sun exposure but the reward was a stunning lakeside camp that I couldn’t pass up. Arrived at 1:30 PM, with the plan to go further, but I just couldn’t pass this site up. I spent hours exploring the area and taking some time to just relax. This was a 20+ mile day since I decided to stay at Mica Lake. The entire trail was easy to follow, but there were a decent amount of blowdowns throughout to navigate. The hike out of Mica Lake takes you to Fire Creek Pass, which offers great 360 views. Just before you reach White Pass, you go over Red pass which offers even more stunning Mountain Views. If it’s clear enough, you may be able to see Mt. Rainier coming down from Red Pass. White Pass offers continuing surrounding Mountain Views. Easy water sources are scarce through a lot of this section. So I would fill up at any chance you get and keep your water full once you come down from Fire Creek Pass. The last day I headed towards the dreaded Indian Creek Trail to complete the circumnavigation. I have to say, the Indian Creek Trail is nowhere near as bad as people act like it is. Don’t get me wrong, there are certainly overgrown sections that can get a bit frustrating at times. It does get head high in spots, but the trail tread is there and it’s consistently broken up by forested sections to give you a break. It’s not a constant 8+ mile stretch of brush. The last 4-5 miles to the White River Trailhead has seen significant trail work so that was easy to follow the rest of the way out to complete the loop. It’s also worth noting, if you’re looking at circumnavigating Glacier Peak, do NOT use the White River Trail to do so. The White River trail is ok maybe a mile or two past the junction with boulder pass and maybe a mile or so off the PCT. Everything in between has not been maintained for 20+ years and is next to impossible to navigate. Use Indian Creek, it’s really not that bad, certainly better than White River. This was one of, if not the best backpacking trips I’ve ever done. I was left very impressed with the Glacier Peak Wilderness. A true backpackers paradise. I don’t understand why it doesn’t get more recognition, but then again maybe that’s a good thing as less recognition keeps it more primitive. Many PCT hikers said that the Glacier Peak stretch was the best section of the PCT, so that says a lot about this place. Glacier Peak is special and I’m already planning a return trip. With that said, this hike is not for beginning backpackers. Without side trips added, this loop is a minimum of 90 miles with significant elevation gains of 25,000+ feet through a remote and primitive wilderness area.",,,,"7,071 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Glacier Peak Circumnavigation What better way to experience the Glacier Peak Wilderness than by hiking round-the-mountain from old-growth glacier valleys to airy alpine ridgelines? This classic volcanic circumnavigation serves up the miles and elevation gain and is best given at least 5-10 days to complete without accounting for side explorations and bad weather. Accessing the loop around Glacier Peak is reasonable from a couple of different trailheads that are many hours of driving apart so location may be the main determinate for where you begin. The most direct access begins on the south side of the mountain at the White River trailhead and is described here heading clockwise. Access points on the other sides of the mountain are described in the “variations” section. If planning a longer trip it is possible to drop a re-supply at one of the alternative trailheads to keep pack weight down. The trails are generally clear of snow from July through October, however, swarms of insects are a nuisance mid-summer making September the ideal time to attempt the full loop. White River Trailhead From the White River trailhead, immediately cross the river on a stout bridge and head north on the Indian Creek Trail. This leg of the loop is notoriously brushy where it passes through large open avalanche paths and may have underbrush obscuring both the sky and the trail at times. Options to camp along Indian Creek are available 4 miles in near the unofficial junction to Airplane Lake and at 7 miles in near the junction with Papoose Creek. At 11 miles, you’ll reach the PCT at Indian Pass with well established camps and good tread. Head north along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) through patches of high meadows under the watch of Indian Head Peak. At mile 12.5, pass the junction with the White River Trail and a poor camp. When in season, blueberries are bountiful along this high stretch around the west side of Glacier Peak. The meadow rambling continues until you reach White Pass at mile 14.9. Campsites are plentiful to the west of the trail and host the multitude of climbers on their way from the North Fork Sauk to the summit. An evening scramble to the summit of White Mountain or a ramble along the Foam Creek Climbers route to the White Chuck Glacier make excellent side trips. From White Pass continue along the PCT to Red Pass at 16.6 miles and descend into the White Chuck Valley. The reddish White Chuck Cinder Cone offers exposed camps near a tarn along its flanks as well as in copses of trees as the headwater valley transitions from barren rock and flowing water to forest. At Red Pass From Red Pass you’ll lose nearly 2600 feet of elevation on quiet forest paths to Baekos Creek at mile 21.1. This section of the Glacier Peak Wilderness gets very little traffic due to lack of access after extensive flooding along the White River. At mile 23.2 stay on the PCT past the junction with trails to Kennedy Hot Springs and Lake Byrne or add about 2 miles descending the White Chuck River Trail to the old hot springs site and then regain the PCT via the Lost Creek Ridge or Kennedy Ridge Trails. Poor camps may be found as you begin climbing out of the White Chuck valley at the crossing of Kennedy Creek or near Pumice Creek at mile 27.8. However, better camps are available as you near Fire Creek Pass (mile 30.8). Fire Creek Pass rewards the climb with magnificent views of the rugged Kennedy Glacier above and the deep blue of Mica Lake below. Tarry for longer than you should before switch backing through rocky fields down to Mica Lake at mile 32.6 which has a few small but excellent camps. Mica Lake to Suiattle From Mica Lake the PCT drops 2000 feet to a crossing of Milk Creek at mile 36.8 before regaining all of it just as quickly. As you round the meadows above East Fork Milk Creek, look for a camp below you at mile 41.6 or continue to Vista Ridge at mile 42.3. Here a faint trail heads north (camps available) for two miles to the summit of Grassy Point which is rumored to have the best views of Glacier Peak. Along Vista Ridge the mountain, flanked in glaciers, feels close enough to reach out and touch. Take in the alpine exposure in this realm of wilderness that at present is reserved for those willing to put in the miles. From Vista Ridge, the PCT descends steep switchbacks that mellow to a mind-numbing grade as you drop 3600 feet to the crossing of the Suiattle River at mile 51.1. At mile 48.5 you’ll pass the junction with the Upper Suiattle River (poor camp available) before heading through groves of old-growth cedar. The bridge across the Suiattle may seem over-built mid-summer but a trip to the upper watershed reveals the true force the river can pack during the spring snowmelt. You’ll meet the loop here if starting the loop from the Suiattle River Trailhead (see variations: Westside Trailheads). To Miners Ridge Head upstream, passing camps at mile 53 and near the junction with the Miners Ridge Trail (mile 53.5). If pressed for time or energy, continue on the PCT (see variations: Middle Ridge Shortcut), otherwise take a left and grind up-hill on the Miners Ridge Trail reaching the ridgeline at mile 57.9. A quick jaunt west will bring you to the Miners Ridge Fire Lookout which may be staffed by volunteers during the summer. Once you’ve taken in the views, head east to Image Lake at mile 58.7 with plentiful camps and a postcard worthy view. Continue past the user trails around the lake to find the Miners Ridge Trail which gets its name from the many small claims along it. Quiet camps can be found along Miners Ridge near mile 60.0 as you near the tree line below Plummer Mountain. At mile 62.4 Miners Ridge meets the PCT again. Heading left will take you to Suiattle Pass (see variations: Chiwawa River Trailheads) but to continue the loop take a right and head down-hill to a crossing of Miners Creek with a campsite at mile 64.2. At mile 64.7, leave the PCT, this time for good, and head south on the Buck Creek Pass Trail which works its way around the forested flanks of Middle Ridge. Pass a side trail to an old sheep camp at mile 66.7 and at mile 69.3 reach Buck Creek Pass. Take the side trail downhill to the pass proper and a large horse camp with a privy. Quieter campsites can be found away from the horse camp. Buck Creek Pass to High Pass High Route At Buck Creek Pass you’ll begin the High Pass High Route section of the circumnavigation. This section follows an old route through airy country that connects Buck Creek Pass to the Napeequa Valley. The route is unmaintained and requires crossing rock and snow fields that may be difficult or necessitate mountaineering equipment at times. For the most part the route follows good trail with well established tread, but route finding may be required. To avoid the High Pass High Route see variations: Chiwawa River Trailheads . Head uphill toward Liberty Cap on an established trail that dishes out views of Helmet Butte and Fortress Mountain amid fields of wildflowers. The route ambles from the west to the east side of the ridgeline as you climb and reaches a bench at mile 72.4 above Triad Lake. Magnificent camps are available on lower rock benches around the lake. From here the trail becomes more obscure and sandy as you drop down to about 7000’ and contour around the steep SE side of Triad Lake. Early in the season this section will be snow and ice covered but reveals a rocky field in late summer. Carefully pick your way through this section and scramble up a short wide gully to reach the high point of the route at High Pass at 7071 feet and 72.9 miles. Sandy flat areas to camp are plentiful. From High Pass, work your way down the sandy slopes into a large basin following paths when possible. Keep the snowfield (or tarn late in season) and the main water course draining the basin below High Pass to your left. At mile 73.1 begin heading steeply downhill into the valley that drains High Pass, following user paths when possible. Poor camps are available as you head down the valley at mile 73.7 (6080 feet) and near the head of a waterfall at mile 74.6 (5560 feet). Look for a trail at the apparent end of the valley that heads into thick slide alder. Follow the rough steep path downhill through the slide alder making use of the strong plant to steady yourself when needed. This section is rough in the best of years but is the easiest way to work your way around the waterfall and drop the last 800’ to the floor of the Napeequa Valley at mile 75.1. Napeequa Hop across the North Fork Naqeequa and pick up the Napeequa River Trail in the rocks. It may be faint at first but becomes more evident and may have flagging to point it out. Then stop, grab a snack, let your heart rate return to normal, and congratulate yourself. You just completed the High Pass High-Route! Follow the Napeequa River Trail down-stream. At mile 76.3 admire Louis Creek as it cascades down from calmer places below Buck Mountain. After crossing Louis Creek a side path leads to a small camp near the river. At mile 77.6 you’ll come to a faint junction with the Boulder Pass Trail. Take the Boulder Pass Trail down to a ford of the Napeequa River which is swift, cold, and deep early in the summer. In late summer and fall it is a mellower mid-thigh to waist deep crossing. Once across, the Boulder Pass Trail steadily climbs out of the Napeequa valley with increasingly spectacular views toward Little Giant Pass. At Boulder Pass, mile 79.8, small camps with big views are available. Larger camps and water can be found about 200’ below the pass on its far side. Down the Boulder Pass trail, additional camps can be found until mile 81.1. At mile 84.5, reach the White River where good camps are available. Take a left on the White River Trail and let your knees enjoy the last few miles of relatively flat rambling along the river before reaching the end of your journey at mile 88.5 Variations West Side Trailheads If you live in the northwest part of Washington, spending an extra day hiking through primeval old growth along the Suiattle or North Fork Sauk may be preferable to a day spent driving to reach the trailheads on the south or east side of the mountain. Starting at the Suiattle River Trailhead will add 13 miles and 2,900 feet of elevation gain round-trip to access the loop. Starting at the North Fork Sauk will add 17 miles and 4,600 feet of elevation gain round-trip to access the loop. Middle Ridge Shortcut Bypassing the splendor of Miners Ridge and Image Lake will save 6 miles and 1,650 feet of elevation gain. At the Junction with the Miners Ridge Trail, stay straight on the PCT rather than heading uphill, which will cross Miners Creek after a mile and then slowly switchback up Middle Ridge in shady forest. 5.1 miles after the Miners Ridge Junction take a right onto the Buck Creek Pass Trail to rejoin the loop at mile 64.6. Chiwawa River Trailheads The Chiwawa River Road offers access to the east side of the Glacier Peak Wilderness via the Little Giant, Buck Creek, and Phelps Creek Trailheads. The main advantage of starting here is the ability to avoid the High Pass High Route by accessing the Napeequa Valley via Little Giant Pass and exiting the loop via the Buck Creek or Phelps Creek trails. The High Pass High Route may be treacherous and require crampons and ice-ax early in the summer. In late summer and early fall the snow has usually melted but some route finding may still be required to descend into the Napeequa valley. Add 12.4 miles and 2,600 feet of elevation gain and loss to bypass the scenic and adventurous 8.3 mile High Pass High Route from Buck Creek Pass to the Napeequa Valley. Start the Glacier Peak circumnavigation at the Little Giant Pass Trailhead. Immediately ford the Chiwawa River, which can be deep and swift in early summer, and climb 4,200 feet in 4.1 miles to Little Giant Pass. From the pass, lose 2,500 feet of the elevation you just gained following 3 miles of narrow and unmaintained switchbacks to reach the junction with the Boulder Pass Trail along the Napeequa River at mile 77.6 in the standard loop. Good camps with water can be found on the far shore of the Chiwawa just after fording the river and 0.6 miles before reaching Little Giant Pass where the trail crosses a small creek. To complete the loop, take the Buck Creek Trail at Buck Creek Pass (mile 69.3 in the standard loop) downhill for 10.2 easy miles to the Chiwawa River Road at Trinity and then hike south along the gravel road for 3.5 miles to your starting point at the Little Giant Pass Trailhead. Exiting via the Lyman Lakes and Phelps Meadows will add 16.9 miles and 4,400 feet of elevation gain and lose to the standard loop while winding through open country past alpine lakes and permanent snowfields. At mile 62.4 in the standard loop, take a left when you reach the PCT toward Cloudy Pass, rather than a right; the mileages that follow are given from this junction. Head NE on the PCT for 0.6 miles then take a right onto the Cloudy Pass Trail. Head uphill, reaching Cloudy Pass with views of Lyman Lake at 1.6 miles. The way then switchbacks down into the Lower Lyman Lake valley reaching established camps at 3.0 miles. Follow the trail around the east end of the Lyman Lakes to Upper Lyman with more camps at 4.4 miles. From Upper Lyman Lakes follow a faint trail or cairns to the Spider gap at 5.7 miles and the high point of this route at 7040 feet. Descend the rocks or the Spider Glacier to its snout where hanging camps (With a privy!) are available with views overlooking the meadowed basin of Phelps Creek at 6.4 miles. Descend into the Phelps Creek valley where dispersed camping is abundant and follow the trail, which eventually becomes a road to the Phelps Creek Trailhead at 13.4 miles. Walk the approach road downhill to the Chiwawa River Road and follow it south to the Little Giant Pass Trailhead at 18.6 miles. Good camps can be found at the Phelps Creek and Alpine Meadows Forest Service campgrounds along the Chiwawa River Road. A bike left at one of the trailheads or a car shuttle can negate the road walk. Hike Description Written by Kyle Pomraning , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"We did Glacier Peak circumnavigation as a 9-day hike with a few long days and a few shorter days Aug. 25-Sept. 2. First, a debt of gratitude: Anyone who hiked this trail in July must have endured a whole lot of suffering. Respect and thanks to the early-season hikers who beat paths around 7ft tall logs (lying down) and through thick brush that obscured the trail and created trip hazards on sketchy cliffsides, and to the tireless trail crews who helped make Indian Creek passable. There were just a few sections, outlined below, that gave us pause. Second, a gripe: the PCT is such an awesome trail. But with so many people burning the miles, there is A LOT of surface pooping going on. Be careful where you step in any of the campsites, or what rock you turn over. I get it: folks are pushing 30mi days and are probably too tired to poop at all, much less bury it. But we encountered a young man who’d traveled to WA for Section K, and fallen violently ill with norovirus or Giardia. He hadn't kept anything in or down in 2 days and was trying to bail off on the Suiattle River Trail. (We offered to walk him to Sulphur Creek CG, at a social distance, carrying his stuff, but he managed to keep water down overnight, said he could do it on his own and had SOS on his iphone, just in case.) Additionally, horse people use campsites below Boulder Pass, and you have to walk around A LOT of horse pee and poo. We weren’t sure our water filters would protect us. (That was our last night, so we’ll wait a couple days and hope for the best.) Please, people. Do better by your fellow hikers and this beautiful part of our state!!! Otherwise, this trip was amazing!!! We’d been wanting to do it for years, and seemed to run into wildfire closures every August. So, this was the year! Day 1 – White River TH to White Pass via Indian Creek. Thanks to trail crews who brushed the trail for the first several miles. If the last 4-5mi were any indication of how bad it had been, your work saved us tons of energy. Those miles were hard, but we never lost the trail, just a lot of pushing through. Once on the PCT, the miles to White Pass went quickly and we enjoyed a beautiful sunset in camp. (About 15mi and 3800ft) Day 2 – White Pass to Glacier Creek. The hike to Red Pass was gorgeous, and we got to scramble Portal Peak (left side of Red Pass heading north). It was fun, ledgy and had great views. After that, we continued down to Glacier Meadows, a lush camping area, and then kept going down to the Whitechuck River, which is milk-white – I’d never seen anything like it – then farther, across the broken but sturdy bridge at Baekos Creek. There are some pretty riverside campsites at Baekos, but we pressed onward past Sitkum, which had a log and a rock hop and some sandy campsites on the other side. Then we crossed Kennedy Creek, which was harrowing. My partner is a field & stream guy, and we had some good beta from a young woman hiking the opposite direction, so we made it across and had a bath – thigh-high on 6’2” Nate and stomach-high on 5’3” me. We got a lot of gravel in our shoes while crossing. I recommend Crocs or something similar. My Xero sandals would not have offered enough stability, so I wore my trail runners and the cleanup was really something!. After that, we switchbacked up Kennedy Ridge and camped at Glacier Creek, a nothing camp spot, but next to water. (About 16mi/4000ft) Day 3 – Glacier Creek to Mica Lake. This was one of the prettiest days on the trail, though thunder and lightning were forecast for the afternoon.We could see the big glaciers on Glacier Peak up close for a while. Fire Creek Pass is stupendous and has some great, but dry, camp spots. We continued down to the lake, where there are a few excellent campsites. We got in at 1pm, and the rain started at 2. But we still got to swim and explore after it passed. It also rained at night. (About 6mi/2600ft) Day 4 – Mica Lake to Milk Creek. I think this was about 11mi, not sure of elevation gain and loss, but it was hard travel in drizzle with wet veg soaking our shoes and rain gear. About 1/2mi and a few hundred feet below Mica Lake is some good camping with a toilet. Continuing down are switchbacks and lots of blowdown to a brushy section on Milk Creek. Before and after the bridge, there’s brush and slippery, rocky trail with steep drop-offs until the switchback trail that goes up about 2000ft. The switchbacks are in decent shape and lead up to the area before Vista Ridge, where there are a couple good but dry campsites. Nate reached Milk Creek’s east fork before I did and was enchanted. I found him blissed out in a campsite, so we made it a shorter day and enjoyed the afternoon, including a bit of rain. Day 5 – East Fork Milk Creek to PCT. A few hundred feet up from our camp was the turnoff to Grassy Point and iconic view of Glacier Peak. You can camp there, but it’s dry. A few hundred feet down is Dolly Creek, with some nothing campsites, but near water. We kept going down, down, down, and through the worst of the blowdown (think jungle gyms) to the Suiattle River through some wonderful old and second growth forest. We had planned for an 18mi day but stopped after 13 to camp on Miner’s Creek next to a big new bridge, after a significant blowdown that required gymnastics. This used to be the Suiattle River crossing before the old bridge blew out, and it was once a great campground, but tree fall decimated all but 2 campsites. We took one, in which a PCTer had left a sacred heart made of sticks (trail magic). The young man with stomach issues came later and took the other site. Day 6 – PCT to Buck Creek trail, up to Buck Creek Pass. After ascertaining that our camp mate could hike on his own, we parted ways, he for Sulphur Creek (and hopefully urgent care and a hotel room), and Nate and I for Buck Creek Pass. A couple big blowdowns on the PCT and the Buck Creek trail, but with workarounds. Buck Creek Pass was empty because the TH is closed for the Pomas fire; we skirted the edge of the closure map and found an amazing campsite with a view of Glacier Peak. (Around 9.5mi and 4300ft up.) Day 7 – A short day up to High Pass, then down to a turquoise tarn on the other side. (4.5mi, 2000ft.) The first boulder field before High Pass required route finding. Like the trip reporter from Aug. 17, we took the lower route and turned up to the left of a big boulder. The route across the second boulder field was obvious. The tarn was one of our favorite sites, though it was full of algae, so we didn’t swim, and we found water sources above it. We took turns napping, reading and rock scrambling the rest of the day. Day 8 – High Pass tarn to Boulder Creek camp at 5200ft. This was another hard travel day! We’d heard about the slippery, steep, brushy slope down to the Napeequa, and we both landed on our butts twice, but it was nothing compared to the overgrown, hard-to-navigate, rocky, rooty 3.5mi on the Napeequa, across the river (again, thigh-high on Nate and stomach-high on me around 1pm) and up 1500ft toward Boulder Pass. Gazing on the Napeequa valley from above is magical, but I’ll be OK if I never visit that valley again. Once the trail busted out into the meadows below Boulder Pass (at 5700ft), my whole mood lightened. The switchbacks to Boulder Pass at 6300ft and down the other side were impressive. We thought we’d find water and camping 200ft below/beyond Boulder Pass, but we only saw one small, sloped campsite near a trickle of water, so we continued down to 5200 and the horse camp. Despite the manure, it was one of the prettiest campsites we stayed in. (12-ish miles, 2200ft?) Day 9 – We got an early start and watched the sunrise hit Clark Mountain - magnificent! 9.2mi down the impressive switchbacks and out the White River trail to our car without incident. We celebrated with warm TH near-beer, hemp milk lattes at the Sasquatch hut near Goldbar and delicious Southern Indian food in Monroe, the first real food we’d had, unless you count the cups and cups of berries we ate on the trail (blueberries, red and purple huckleberries, salmonberries, salal and the last of the thimbleberries). I'm beyond thrilled that we finally got this one done, and I highly recommend it to hardy hikers with backpacking, scrambling and fording experience and good cheer in tough conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Day 1: Started around 2pm with our party of 4. About a 5 hour hike to camp, 5 miles, 4500ft. Beautiful views of Baker and Baker lake on the way up. About a mile from camp, the trail turns North and becomes a climber’s trail heading straight toward the glacier. We roped up for the last 20 minutes of hiking to high camp, and navigated around several medium-sized crevasses. We camped on the plateau at around 6400ft. We didn’t see the composting toilet at camp, but the map shows it on the ridge to Southwest. Only saw one other party of 2 camping on the ridge. Day 2: Started hiking at 2:45am. We were happy we started at this time both for more stable snow and avoiding the brutal heat later in the day. The first steep section of the Sulphide had many large crevasses and moats with waterfalls running underneath, but this section can easily be avoided by sticking to the climber’s left side below the rock rib. We started a bit too far left and had to traverse across a couple of rock islands. The flat section of glacier above was easy walking with no visible crevasses and a clear bootpack to follow. We followed the ridge up the lefthand side close to the intersection with the Fischer chimneys route. Found a couple snow bridges to cross that were wide and holding up well. Near the summit pyramid there are some narrow cracks hidden beneath snow, and we punched through one of these waist deep. Otherwise the route is in great shape for this point in the season. Reached the summit pyramid and started climbing the gully around 6am as the sun was rising. This was a fun class 3 scramble with some interesting moves on solid rock. Be careful about knocking down loose rocks. It’s easy to get pulled too far right onto the SE ridge route, but if trying to follow the gully, stick to climber’s left. There are 2 options near the top to summit - a steeper gully on the right, or gaining the ridge on left and going around the summit block to the left. We were the first party on the summit at around 7:45am. Saw two more small parties on the way down, then a couple large, maybe guided, groups coming up around 11am. Spent about a half hour on the summit, then made 3 rappels, with some downclimbing in between, to the bottom of the gully. The first rap anchor is skier’s left, looking back toward the route, of the summit block. There were plenty of rap anchors and the ones on skier's right were in good condition with newer webbing, cord and rap rings. On the last section on the way down we found a path through the rocks on continuous snow, although some of the moats there will likely not hold up much longer. Back at camp at 12:30pm, then hiked out the same day. Fun trip with a great group, no crowds, and interesting climbing!",,,,"9,127 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Mount Shuksan A climb of Mount Shuksan via the Sulphide Glacier.,,,,,,,,"This report is for a one day attempt on Mt. Shuksan via the Whitesalmon glacier. Warning depending on conditions avalanche danger on the Whitesalmon glacier itself and in the basin below the glacier can be extreme. The hillside leading from the ski area down to Whitesalmon creek is currently only partially snow covered. There is better snow coverage down in the basin. There are a ton of old avalanche debris in the lower end of the basin as well as directly under the glacier. These were frozen and difficult to get over, conditions for skiing were miserable. I ended up booting the entire time. Snow conditions were variable and not elevation dependent. They seemed more dependent on factors like sun, or lack there of, recieved during the day and windloading. At times icey with a non breakable crust and at others a breakable crust. The glacier was in fairly good condition, crevasses were filled in pretty well, but not as much as what one would normally expect this time of year. When I reached the top of the Whitesalmon I was about an hour away from my turn around time so I called that my high point for the day and turned around. I'll attempt this route again at some point with more daylight, January days are so short, and more low elevation snow pack to help with the approach, maybe not this year..

Follow signs to stay on the Skyline Trail until, at half a mile, you see a sign for the Deadhorse Creek Trail . Veer left (north) at that junction to connect with Deadhorse. At the next junction, go hard left (southwest) on the Deadhorse Creek Trail. In 250 feet, a small sign on the right announces the Moraine Trail. Go right, leaving asphalt behind, shortly passing a sign reading “End of maintained trail. Travel safely causing minimum impact beyond here.” Pass through a small stand of trees, then descend gently into the open. A ridge to your right now separates you from the often crowded area you just left. Continue gently downhill on pleasant trail. When you see the trail divide, avoid the left (lower) trail. Both paths go to the same place, but the lower trail drops steeply through treacherously loose and slippery terrain. Instead, just continue straight on the upper trail. At 1 mile, step across the stream and walk to the edge of the moraine at 1.1 miles, where it connects with the lower trail. Before you wander the edge of the moraine for varied views, notice that the trail below is unsafe in places, simply too close to the loose gravelly edge of the moraine. Admire the broad Nisqually River valley and what remains of the Nisqually Glacier several hundred feet below, or just gaze at the summit. When you are ready, return to the asphalt paths the way you came, and then decide where to go next.

I would recommend to really try to lighten your pack and if you can buy a lighter piece of gear before attempting this DO IT. We slogged up to heart lake and then took a long break including a swim. We worked up the catwalk and dirt gullies, the cat walk took longer than expected but the sidehilling was not as bad as expected. We got to Boston Charlie around 9pm. 7/18 We continued and found 11 bull basin to be a better looking campsite if you can make it there. The climb to drop down to Stephen lake was obvious and after we found the first snow of the trail. After Stephen lake the route finding becomes more tough, I had to refer to gps track on phone often as we climbed out of Stephen basin and then were on snow for a while. We did not use traction yet. We reached ferry basin after a long day around 6:45 pm. 7/19 Long day to camp pan We found two groups including one doing the same loop and followed them up the endless snow fields and rocky moonscape of the southern baileys. This part is all above tree line. We traversed the top of Childs glacier and dropped into queets basin. We trusted our gps track and followed game trail after game trail until reaching forested slopes and sliding down in to the stream that would take us to the humes. We hopped on the humes glacier which was bare ice for 500 feet before being snow covered until the pass to camp pan. We had brought a heavy ass 9.5 mm 60 meter rope and 2 pickets, the other team was unroped completely which seemed doable but not my style. 7/20 Camp pan had the best views of Milky Way. at night. We worked across the heavily crevasses Hoh glacier but nothing too scary. We climbed glacier pass which was super tiring and reached the blue. We had planned to summit Olympus but after ruining out of fuel the night before we decided that it would not be fun to have cold food for 2 days after such an effort. So we decided to try to get out a day early. We continued down the long Hoh River trail and ate endless berries along the way. If you are planning on exiting out the sol Duc and making it a loop, DONT underestimate the climb up the Hoh lake trail which was so demoralizing. 7/20 finally we climbed to the high divide and saw our first bears by Hoh lake.

This time we went in the sol duc and out the elwha via dodger point. I learned a lot 2 years ago and you really need to be dialed on the route description, coordinates, gps, and map study. We were much better prepared this time. Getting to Boston Charlie was a long day but very manageable. We summited Mount Carrie in the evening as a side trip. There is a good water source on the way down from Carrie (maybe 10 mins out of the way). Getting to ferry basin is a LONG day. Don’t let the short distance fool you. We went the cream lake route, above cream lake the trail completely disappeared and we spent hours getting cliffed out and bushwhacking our way in circles. We eventually bailed and took a diagonal traverse to the ridge below and past Stephen peak. It got a bit sketchy but it worked! Met some other hikers who claimed Stephan basin is way better than cream lake in terms of travel. Ferry basin was beautiful but it was getting late so we made our way up to the lower glacial lake and camped. We did 1 day out of the way to travel as much of the baileys as we could before descending down to dodger point. The goal was to explore and spend some more time up high. We went to Mount Childs and then back to ferry basin. We actually kept pushing all the way to the Scott ludden saddle and camped there. This section from Mount ferry to Scott ludden was so much harder and longer than we thought it would be. We even saw a cougar off In the distance!! The final .5 miles took us 2 hours to the Scott ludden saddle. It was a horrendous bushwhack worse than the snowfinger. We definitely lost the route but kept trying and couldn’t find anything. It was a similar situation to cream lake where the gps said we were on route but we simply were not and were cliffed out at times. After 2 hours of hard bushwhacking and constant up and down and traveling in circles, we found an upper meadow and rock ramp that we descended. We immediately threw up our tent and crashed for 10 hours in the meadow of the Scott ludden saddle! The next couple of days we took our time getting out as we had the time off and wanted to really enjoy our time in the mountains. The final couple of hours of off trail were hard but manageable. The route was much easier to find but still very challenging! Enjoyed our time at dodger point and humes ranch! epic trip and happy to have finally come back from the baileys victorious!

One previous report mentions it’s like “rollerballs under your feet,” which I think is a very accurate description. I understand why this is done as a traverse, or better yet, a backpacking trip . Watch for mountain goats, I met plenty at Aasgard Pass as well as ascending Dragontail. Little Annapurna is straightforward with minimal scrambling and exposure. Follow the cairns closely on Little Annapurna and through the Core Zone in general, as they will help you avoid backtracking and bushwhacking. The views from both Dragontail and Little Annapurna are stunning, with close views of Rainier, as well as the Enchantment Range including Mount Stuart, Colchuck, Argonaut, McClellan, and Prusik, the upper Enchantments basin as well as panoramic views of the Cascades both north and south. There’s also great views of the Teanaway; it was awesome to spy Bean, Earl, and Teanaway Peaks. There are plentiful water sources at Colchuck Lake as well as the Core Zone tarns, limited water at Aasgard pass, and on Dragontail and Little Annapurna sections. I brought 2.5L with me and filtered 3.5L more. On the Dragontail ascent there are cairns from the top of Aasgard marking a path higher up on the rockfield which helps to avoid the glacier/snowfield until you are at about 8300ft. I’d recommend downloading a .gpx from prior ascents or map the route on Caltopo. The crux of the ascent starts here and involves an approximately 200 ft ascent up the top lip of a steep snow climb. The snow is soft enough to kick steps, however the ascent requires a prolonged steep sidehill traverse. I strongly recommend crampons and an ice axe here, as the runout here drops 200+ feet steeply onto rock outcroppings. The ascent from the snowfield to the summit is pretty straightforward, and consists of a bootpath interspersed with easy scrambles. I used microspikes and hiking shoes for this section, and ascended relatively late at 12:15. This combo predictably led to a loss of traction on my descent down the snowfield traverse leading to a 100 ft slide. Thankfully I was able to self-arrest and came out with only a sprained ankle to show for my lack of caution, but learn from me - wear crampons and go early!

The Pulaski Tunnel is well established super fun trail, but Pulaski Mountain was going to require some serious route finding. After conferring with a Wallace local we decided an old mining road, heading up from Placer Creek was the way to go. In retrospect I believe this road was likely mining first but then used as the original lookout access in the thirties. Starting with the Pulaski Tunnel Trail we had a cool day with glorious sunshine. As a note of disgust the vandals who have wrecked some of the decorative features along this trail should be ashamed. As you cross the creek an old, blocked road turns off to the right. Though overgrown in spots this road is in remarkably good condition despite many decades of disuse. Follow this old road up to 3700’ where a newer road has cut across the hillside. The new road cut has pushed huge amounts of rock down onto your trail but this is quickly circumvented. Once on the new road look across the road and up the bank for the continuation of your trail/road. This type of road interruption will occur several more times on your way. Once the twenty year-old clear cut is reached the track becomes much harder to follow. We thrashed about a bit though aided by the resident elk population which has trails throughout this area. Following our Gaiagps mapping made life fairly easy and we were soon at point 4965’. From here the going was noticeably easier, though perhaps only because we could see where we were headed. When we gained the final 500’ slope a well defined miner’s rod had returned. Old burn was evident and the wild flowers were abundant. Near the summit we chatted with some friendly ATVers who’d come up from the west. Lounging at the summit we enjoyed expansive views and fantastic wildflowers. A few fire lookout remnants were extant. Our dreams turned to burgers and beers in Wallace and the 2700’ descent back into town.",,,,"3,720 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Pulaski Tunnel Trail This North Idaho interpretive trail is easily accessible from I-90 and is not-to-be missed for its rich history of the 1910 fires. WTA's volunteer trail workers are well versed in the use of the Pulaski as an all-around best grubbing tool for a variety of trail projects. They may even be aware of the man who designed the tool, Ed Pulaski, a forest service employee and firefighter based out of the mining town of Wallace. North Idaho's Pulaski Trail delves into the history of the man, the tool he designed, and the 1910 wildfires that still leave their mark on North Idaho. This is an interpretive trail, so plan to spend as much time reading the trailside signs as hiking on this four mile round-trip hike along a creek. At trails-end is the tunnel and commemorative markers indicating where Ed Pulaski saved all but six of the 45 firefighters under his command by holding them at gunpoint in a mine tunnel. His armed insistence on their remaining inside the tunnel saved them from smoke inhalation and the high temperatures outside their shelter. Due the significance of the events that happened here in August 1910, both the trail and the tunnel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Teachers and scout leaders, be sure to check out the educational materials provided by the Forest Service. The first 725 feet of this trail is barrier-free.

It is not long, four miles out and back. But it does have some points of interest and a very nice history to it. There are some interpretive signs along the way that explain the story, which is a heroic one. The trail is named for the man who saved many lives during an extreme fire that swept the area in 1910. The trailhead is just outside the city limits of Wallace, Idaho, a very quaint town with a storied past. Mining was big here back in the day. The Sunday I hiked it the trail had many families with small kids and dogs. The trails end features a place to sit, some interpretive signs, and the entrance to an abandoned gold mine, where the story unfolded. No bugs along the way, trail in good shape.

Climb through a gorge past a creek that feeds into the mighty Columbia to the top of a plateau that offers fantastic views down to the huge river making its way to the Pacific Ocean. Built by the Friends of the Gorge with assistance from WTA, the trail is a nice leg stretch for folks touring the Gorge.

The first level drops about 70 feet, while the upper falls is shorter, at just 10 feet high. The swirling pool between the two falls is inaccessible from the trail. Past the falls, the trail climbs steadily with switchbacks and three sets of stairs up a steep, open hillside to a viewpoint on the Mosier Plateau. The hillside and plateau are home to plentiful flowers, such as Columbia desert parsley, yellow bells, and grass widows. Across the river, the Coyote Wall trail is just visible on the Washington side. From here it is best to return the way you came.

The property is a relatively new acquisition for Fish & Wildlife, which purchased the 2,772 acre property in two phases in 2008 and 2009. Trailhead signage is improving, making it easier for visitors to locate the correct access points, but it is still a work in progress, so visitors need to come prepared with navigation tools. The Holly Road access point is one of three designated trail heads for the Wildlife Area. The trailhead is located at a high point on the property, just west of Fan Lake (a non-motorized lake that's great for a post-hike swim). Begin the hike by descending down a hill for approximately one mile on an old roadbed. Over the course of that one mile the trail passes through three distinct ecosystems. Initially, it's all pine trees with an open understory, blanketed in wildflowers in the springtime. In the middle section there's still some pine, but Doug-fir becomes the predominant tree. By the bottom of the hill, it's a lush cedar forest. It's also a wetland, and the mosquitoes may be fierce depending on when hikers visit. At the bottom of the hill, there's a single-track trail that breaks off to the left of the old roadbed and crosses a small stream. There are no trail markers, so keep careful watch for it. (Note Pruffer Barn across the wetland, as this is the landmark to watch for on the return portion of the loop.) This trail goes slightly uphill toward Horseshoe Lake for about a mile and a half. It's the prettiest section of the hike since it's all single-track, gorgeous forest, and wildflowers in season. It also boasts some seasonal muddy spots, so waterproof shoes are advised. At approximately the 2.5 mile mark, the trail comes out on Horseshoe Lake Road. To complete the loop hike, hikers need to hike the road for a few hundred feet to the West trailhead for the property, where there's a wide parking area along the road (an alternate access point for this loop), and a kiosk with a map of the property. The loop then continues on an old roadbed. There are some intersecting roadbeds and no trail signage, so this next part is a little trickier, but the trail here is basically an old farm road that gradually descends the wetland, roughly parallel to the single-track trail up the wetland. The roadbed has good views of the wetland, including an active beaver pond. Eventually, hikers will come to the old barn. From there, return to the intersection with the single-track trail and retrace the route of the first mile, ascending the roadbed back to the trailhead. Since this is a Wildlife Area, hikers need to be aware of various hunting seasons throughout the year, as hunting is a permitted activity on this property. This is also a popular equestrian area, so hikers who arrive in passenger cars should take care in how they park at the trailhead in order to allow trailers to turn around with ease.  Improvements to parking at Holly Road are currently being planned.

The medium version: Although the road to get to the Wynoochee Pass trailhead is rough, it is passable, and the trail itself is in pretty good shape all the way to the pass. There are maybe two or three blowdowns, and there are several creek crossings, but at present none is particularly difficult. After reaching the pass, it's a bit of a challenge to find the way trail that cuts across and meets up with the Graves Creek trail to get to Lake Sundown. But once you find the trail, it's not hard to follow, with or without the flagging that currently helps guide the way. The long version (and either buckle in or choose to move on to other trip reports, because this will indeed be a long version): The description of my actual hike will come towards the end, but I want to begin with some background about this trail. Let's start with the way this trail has been named and described by WTA. If you search the site for ""Wynoochee Pass,"" you'll find many trip reports for a hike that was previously categorized by WTA as ""Wynoochee Pass to Sundown Lake."" A few years ago, for some reason, WTA changed the name to ""Sundown Lake Way Trail"" and updated the description to the current "" This former route towards Sundown Lake in Olympic National Forest is no longer navigable."" Regardless of what you think about finding the route all the way to Lake Sundown, the Wynoochee Pass trail is an active, maintained, navigable route, even if it doesn't see a lot of traffic. Both the Forest Service and the Park Service seem to have done work on this trail in the recent past. The bypass through the landslide area at the beginning of the trail (more on that later) in particular has been reworked and is far less sketchy than when I was last here four or five years ago. After you reach Wynoochee Pass on this trail -- the pass is the divide between the Wynoochee drainage and the Upper Quinault drainage via Graves Creek, and it is marked by two ponds on relatively flat ground at the top of the pass -- things get more interesting. There are two routes from here to get to Lake Sundown. First, as shown on most maps (Custom Correct, NatGeo, Gaia, the Park Service interactive map, and even on the Google Maps link from the page for this hike, if you zoom in enough), you can continue along the Wynoochee Pass trail, which descends about 1,000 feet until it meets up with the Graves Creek trail coming over from the Quinault area. Then the trail turns sharply and goes back uphill, switching back up 1,200 feet to the lake. The second route, which is what I think of as the ""way trail,"" cuts off most of that down-and-up, contouring along the hillside at ~3,400' in elevation from just below the pass, to meet up with the trail coming back up from Graves Creek, joining it at the apex of the last switchback. This cuts off about 800' of gain coming back up from the junction with the Graves Creek trail, although to be sure this way trail is not without its own ups and downs. If you read through trip reports for this hike here and elsewhere, you'll see that there's a lot of confusion about which of these two options people are describing, and I believe WTA's change in the name and description of this hike has compounded the issue. Some are looking for the way trail but stumble along the main trail for the full down and up. Some hikers (including me, on my two previous tries) search in vain for the way trail and return the way they came, with a nice day hike to the pass and back under their belts. And some thru-hike it via Six Ridge to the North Fork of the Skokomish or via Sundown Pass to the South Fork. Now, I've hiked the Graves Creek trail from the trailhead shared with the Enchanted Valley hike, but not as far as the junction with the trail coming down from Wynoochee Pass, nor have I done the full down-and-up from Wynoochee Pass to the Graves Creek trail and back up to Lake Sundown. Therefore, I don't have first-hand knowledge, but my understanding is that this down-and-up, sometimes in conjunction with taking the Graves Creek trail past Success Creek, is what gives this area a reputation for endless blowdowns. The route I took had a few blowdowns, but not notably more than many other, more-traveled trails in the Olympics. The hike: Be careful about the route to the trailhead. As others have noted, Google Maps has a tendency to take you on a non-existent route. Adding to this confusion, Google also numbers the main road into the area variously FS-2270 and/or NF-2312. Stick with the directions on the WTA page, and you'll get there. I would add one detail to this portion of the directions: "" Follow FS Road 2270 11.7 miles to the FS Spur Road #400 (2270-400)."" Note that to stay on 2270, you have to take a left turn and cross a bridge over the Wynoochee. It's marked here, and it's clear that the forest road continuing straight ahead at this turn is of a diminished grade, but it's worth noting that you have to make this turn. There has been some work on 2270, so it's not a bad drive. There used to be suspension-killing potholes immediately after crossing the bridge, but those have been fixed, and large stretches before that have had fresh gravel added. The -400 spur, which is marked with a masonite sign and has a ""WYNOOCHEE PASS"" sign nailed to a tree above eye level, is considerably rougher, and this is where a high-clearance vehicle would be appreciated. The road eventually ends just before an old washout and widens into a small parking area with room for a handful of cars. There is newish trailhead signage here from the Forest Service. The first order of business is crossing the old slide area. As I recall, this used to be a bit precarious, but it has clearly been improved significantly, with some large-stone gravel used to regrade the trail. If you know the landslide area on Pyramid Mountain/Peak above Lake Crescent, this slide was never that bad, but it was a lot closer to that than it is now. I don't think anyone would be intimidated crossing it today. The trail continues on the old roadbed for a short while, and then it reaches what was the original trailhead, with a registration box. (The old roadbed switches back to the left here, and I believe that's an alternate route up Discovery Peak, but I haven't climbed it from this side.) You are now in the forest proper, and it's a lovely trail. Soon you encounter signage letting you know that you are entering the national park. This trail is obvious and easy to follow. It continues for about 2.5 miles up to the actual pass. The trail is varied along the way. There are steeper sections, often rooty, mixed with flat portions, and some swampier, grassy areas here and there. There are also several creek crossings. Some of these could be precarious in the spring thaw, but none presents a challenge currently. You have to pick your steps carefully getting down into and up out of a couple of the creek beds, but it's fine. There is a six- or seven-foot scramble out of one of the creeks that involves handholds, but even this is pretty tame. There are some beautiful old trees throughout this hike, including one giant guardian that, if I recall correctly, is nestled in the crook of the one big switchback on the trail, so you get to admire it from all angles. There were ripe and ripening berries throughout this part of the hike. I enjoyed all the salmonberries, blueberries and huckleberries I cared to sample. It looks like the thimbleberries have already come and gone, though. Eventually, you come out to Wynoochee Pass, which as noted above is distinguished by two ho-hum ponds. The trail skirts alongside these, and there is a relatively flat, rocky mound up here, which could be a good place for a break. I was surprised that it wasn't buggier, but I didn't stop to see whether they would home in on me. It was cloudy today, but I know from previous visits that this area isn't known for big views, which is partly why I chose it on an overcast day. OK, here's where it really gets interesting. If you want to use the way trail -- and for all of the reasons stated above, I believe you do -- go about 1/4 mile downhill beyond the pass. If you're looking carefully for it, there is a faint trail that leads down to the right into a lush green meadow. This meadow is marshy, so step carefully. The crux of this route is finding the correct exit from the meadow on the far side. I got turned around here looking for it, as you'll see on the map I've attached. The trick is that it's kind of a double meadow down and to the left, so you want to get all the way to the other side down there and look for the trail leading out of the area back into the trees. I went straight across and entered the woods too early, chasing game trails at first. If you pick up the trail again, to my mind, you're home free! It's not hard to follow, nor are there many obstacles on it. Shortly after exiting the meadow, there is a ravine to cross, but the trail angles down into it and then back out of it. In fact, this way trail is in better shape than the ""real"" trail you pick up on its far side. That trail is very brushy, a problem that the way trail doesn't share, because it's mostly forested without a lot of undergrowth. The worst of the blowdowns are also on that final portion of the ""real"" trail up to the lake, but nothing insurmountable if you're the intrepid type to take on this hike. Eventually you reach a split in the trail, with a sign for Sundown Pass and an arrow pointing right. Go left to get to Lake Sundown. Soon you cross a beautiful open meadow area, then pop back into the woods for a final push to the lake. Some reviews have said the lake isn't that impressive, but I found it gorgeous, especially with the lush green hillside arising out of it on the far side. The only animals I saw were grouse and one other hiker on the way trail. We were both quite surprised to see each other! There was a lot of bear and cougar scat around, though, as well as some elk prints up by the pass. The entire hike car-to-car is just about 10 miles roundtrip. Notes on the attached map image: I've included a screenshot from Gaia. I recorded my track only from the point of departure from the Wynoochee Pass trail to the lake. I have added four key waypoints. The two outermost waypoints were locations I grabbed from someone else's trip report. They show the locations where you exit and rejoin the main trail. The first one was spot on; the second was a little off, but close enough. This second one is important mainly to ensure you don't miss the turnoff on the return. First point: 47.53510, -123.53197 Second point: 47.53317, -123.52328 The inner waypoints are the entry into the meadow and the exit from the meadow back onto the way trail. I found the exit to be important on the way to the lake and the entry to be important on the return, to find your way back up to Wynoochee Pass. As you can see from my track, I wandered around for a bit before finding the correct exit. Entry: 47.53477, -123.53190 Exit: 47.53383, -123.52996 I plan to email this trip report to WTA and humbly suggest that they update how they characterize this trail. I think at the least, they should have a regular listing for the Wynoochee Pass trail, which is a route in good standing with both the Forest Service and the Park Service. The current ""Sundown Lake Way Trail"" entry might be more appropriate for the two routes outlined above that go from the pass to the lake. I would happily volunteer to lead a hike for anyone from WTA who wants to see the area and confirm this for themselves! If you've read this far, I hope you found it informative. I know it's a lot, but I wanted to write, if not the definitive description of the trail(s), at least a trip report that collects a lot of information and I hope resolves some of the confusion.",,,,"3,820 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47.5163 , -123.5393 Map & Directions",,,,,,,"Hiking Sundown Lake Way Trail The Sundown Lake Way Trail has faded into history over the years, and even veteran hikers have a hard time  following it. Formerly a ""sister"" to the Upper South Fork Skokomish trail, this route paralleled the Upper South Fork Skok, beginning in Olympic National Forest and then entering the National Park to join the trails near Sundown Lake. Now though, the Sundown Lake Way Trail has been reclaimed by the forest. Visitors will need route-finding and map reading skills, and a hardy disposition to navigate the former route. Toilet Information No toilet at trailhead More information about toilets WTA worked here in 2018! Hike Description Written by Multiple authors contributed to this report, WTA Community",,,,,,,," Finally checked this one off of my bucket list. We started at Wynoochee Pass TH and used the way trail to go on up to Sundown Lake for a few nights. Road: long, dusty and potholed. Better with high clearance vehicle. But if you go slow, everyone should be ok. Trail to Pass: Pretty easy. There is a rock slide at very beginning of trail. With the amount written about this, I expected a much worse scene. It was easy and no problem at all. About 2 miles in is a worse section. The trail was eroded at the point where it crosses a stream. It was difficult to get a footing because of loose dirt and rocks. I was very uncomfortable with my overnight pack going down. On the way back I ended up taking off my pack to climb up. It’s definitely doable just something to be aware of.  Also a few downed trees. All passable, some just take a moment to figure out how to go over/around/under. Before getting to the pass, the trail becomes overgrown. This really narrows the path and makes it very easy to take a misstep and slide down the hill. There were many sections where it was obvious someone did just that. Be careful. It’s difficult to see where you are stepping. The pass was very pretty. Wildflowers and berries everywhere. As well as mosquitos. Now on to the way trail. The report from Sabbaru below was a life saver. I saved the way points. I would have never found the entrance to the way trail without the first waypoint. We turned off and went down a pretty steep decline. A few pink flags marked the trail. It popped us out into the first meadow. There really wasn’t any path and again without the waypoint from Sabbaru below I would have wandered around in circles. When we entered the meadow I used my GPS to make my way diagonally across the meadow. Step carefully. It is very marshy.  Take note there are two meadows. You will go through a small wooded area to second meadow before getting to the outer edge of the final meadow. There is a pink flags marking a tree and almost directly behind it is the path leading up and out. Shortly you will come to a small ravine with a rope to help you get down. Not very steep at all. The rest of the trail is fairly easy to navigate. At this point it was the pink ribbons that helped me find the way. They are there. Just have to look really carefully. I think I would have eventually found my way because there is a trail. But it would have taken me way longer without the ribbons because there are game trails everywhere. If you plan to take way trail back I suggest recording your path so you can follow it back. It is very easy to miss the final trail up out of meadow back to main trail Finally we connected to the main trail. Now. Here is where it gets bad! Reports talk about overgrowth. This was overgrowth on steroids. I am unsure how much longer this trail will be navigable without some maintenance. The overgrowth completely takes over the trail and the brush on the cliff side is slowly eroding the trail. Also the woody trailing evergreens result in thick branches that are about an inch above the ground and completely hidden. Huge tripping hazards. The trail is very narrow. And there are even sections that have eroded leaving a hole on the trail which cannot be seen. Which could result in a very painful fall. This is a very dangerous section of trail. Be careful going through. Finally made it to intersection for Sundown Lake. The trail to Lake is absolutely stunning. Gorgeous meadows, wildflowers and views. The lake is beautiful. There is a campsite right at beginning of loop around lake. We walked as far as we could go for the second campsite. We were stopped at a significant slide. Someone rigged a rope but for the life of me I couldn’t see a way to make it work safely for me. So I turned back. I think the Park Service should NOT issue unlimited permits for this area. If one person is at the first established campsite you don’t have many other options. There is a gravely rocky flat area at the base of trail leading to Six Ridge. Not ideal. There is one flat spot on meadow area before entering the lake. Completely exposed. So if someone is in the one established site. And you cannot navigate to second campsite. Well. Not many other options. I even used a raft to search the edges of entire lake and never saw a second campsite. Also. The campsite has no lake access. You can’t even see the lake behind the vegetation. You have to walk down and around, over a creek to get to the lake. Now the lake was beautiful. Fish were jumping. But I prefer a campsite where I can walk out my tent, sit in my chair and see/walk to the lake.  I am glad I checked this off my bucket list. But would not do it if I was looking for a relaxing lakeside backpack camp experience. One of the days we hiked to  Sundown Pass. Stunning views. The pass is literally a sign at a tree. We continued for another 1/4 mile and popped out into an amazing meadow with tarns and view for miles.definitely worth the extra 2 miles round trip on a fairly easy trail. Lastly the reported miles are off. I recorded 7 miles to lake and almost same exact mileage back. Making it about 14 miles round trip. I have never done the regular trail so I can’t say if it is easier or longer? The way trail is definitely doable and I am extremely grateful for Sabbaru (trip report below) for sharing the waypoints. Mosquitos and Horse flies: out in force. Armies of them. I hope this helps anyone considering this hike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another note is to make sure you have a good pair of fitted shoes, the trip back from Johnson Ridge Observatory is all down hill on a fairly steady decline and your toes will be hitting the inside of your toe box if they aren't.

After a shy mile keep left on the Boundary Trail to ascend to Johnston Ridge, hiking three miles to the Loowit Viewpoint and another shy mile to the Johnston Ridge Observatory. The trail here is exposed, so bring plenty of sun protection and water. The views of the broken mountain and the bare plains surrounding it get more dramatic with every step! Escape the heat and refill your water bottle in the Observatory, or listen to a presentation by one of the knowledgeable rangers. On your way back, keep left at the junction with the Hummocks Trail to complete the loop along the North Fork Toutle River, and then through marshlands and young forest back to the parking lot. Going further : As you see early in your hike, the Hummocks Trail is also the start of the Boundary Trail, stretching to the east for 57 miles to Council Lake in the heart of the South Cascades.

We got back to our car at 4:10, just as NPS staff were driving around the lot with loudspeakers telling everyone they had five minutes to leave. I checked the Hurricane Ridge webcam today and the parking lot is completely empty, so it looks like they may have closed it for the weekend or for the entire government shutdown.

This small channel was a fecund stew of nastiness, and contained quite noticeable algae(?) blooms and other nasty looking byproducts. Where the small channel rejoins the river, there was a whirlpool of heavy foam. I'm not including any pics of this mess because A, I was too disgusted to take any, and B, if you read this report, I don't want you to see what I saw. It was absolutely heartbreaking and disgusting.

However, in the photo I uploaded, you can see all the foam swirling in the water where the small channel returns to the river. My question is this: should we the public expect better of nature areas that we own and that we entrust the government to manage, and profit from?

Trail to Bruni's snow bowl: 3.5 miles from the TH. not much snow, only 2-3 patches of snow. The last ½ mile to the Bruni's bowl has consistent snow, but there's none surrounding the Hut. Went to the Gazebo too, very beautiful, with so many interesting things inside. a huge thank you to Judy and her family and the volunteers who built this beautiful place. I could see St Helens, Adams in the distance and Rainier obviously was the star of the show. Only 2 people were living in the hut then, but on my way back saw another 5-6 people were heading to the Hut. Trail to High Hut: 3 miles from TH. Only snow is on the last stretch to the Hut. 0.3 miles only. slippery snow at the end of the day, but not too much deep. barely 2-3 inch deep at places. A group of 6 women were staying at the Hut, they welcomed me inside and we hung out there for an hour. my intention was to catch the sunset, and I wasn't disappointed at all. We saw a fiery sunset, the Mountain was glowing and the western sky was in fire! After the sunset, I walked back 3 miles to the TH in the dark. didn't see anyone in the dark.

Beware mosquitoes near the marsh!",,,,"3,280 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Liberty Lake Regional Park - Liberty Lake Loop Trail Liberty Lake Regional Park has it all: lakeshore, wetlands, a campground, an ORV park, BBQ areas and playgrounds. But the draw for hikers is the network of excellent backcountry trails. There are ample opportunities for any number of out and back hikes but for the full tour of all the trail highlights, hike the Liberty Lake Loop Trail. Start out from the parking area on the Liberty Creek trail which officially begins just past the campground. You will have to walk from the parking area a short ways to the trailhead. After just under a mile you will come to a junction that marks the beginning of the loop. You can go either way since both trails eventually connect back to this same spot, but most hikers choose to take the left fork. From here the trail goes for just under half a mile before coming to another fork. Stay left to get close to the creek on the Split Creek Trail (revamped by WTA in 2019) or stay right to remain in the trees on the Liberty Creek Trail. Both trails closely parallel each other and are virtually the same length. These two trails merge after .85 miles to deliver hikers to a cedar grove, a good place to rest up and stare in awe at some tall trees. The trail quickly leaves this grove behind as it ascends up a dozen switchbacks to Sam Hill. As you near the top look out to views of Liberty Lake below. The tour of attractions continues ahead as you come to Liberty Falls and then, after rounding the corner and heading up another short section of switchbacks, the Camp Hughes Cabin. From the cabin, wind down and descend along the Edith Hansen Trail where you might encounter horseback riders. Stay straight at the junction for the Mica Peak Trail unless you want some additional mileage and elevation gain on this spur that makes for a good destination on its own. Keep on to meet back up with the trail to the parking lot. Note that Spokane County Parks charges a $10 vehicle parking fee during the summer months (see Driving Directions below for details). Discover Passes do not apply/are not necessary for County Parks. The loop can also be accessed via two other methods (which do not require paying the vehicle parking fee): Via the Idaho Road (equestrian) trailhead in Liberty Lake Regional Park. Via the Mackenzie Reserve , using the Zephyr Connector trail. Please note that the reserve's parking lot is small. WTA worked here in 2019!

Begin at Selkirk Lodge, a place that is generally filled past capacity on a sunny weekend during Nordic ski season, but almost always devoid of cars come the warmer months of the year. Follow any of the Nordic Trails leading out to Nova Hut at Junction 3, passing through second-growth forests on old logging roads that have been converted to one of the state's best Nordic trail systems. Late summer users can expect to find huckleberries and could potentially see resident deer, moose, coyote, or black bear. The trail system here is open to non-motorized multi-use, but is rarely busy. From Junction 3, hikers should follow the Quartz Mountain Loop Trail (part of the Nordic system, and not the same trail as the one leading to the summit of nearby Quartz Mountain, home of a rentable fire lookout cabin). Approximately 1 mile into the hike along the loop, watch for the sign on the right indicating the way to Ragged Ridge. The trail drops down to a saddle, entering a Natural Forest Area (NFA) and quickly changing from an ecosystem that has been heavily impacted by human use into a near-wilderness. The NFA and Natural Area Preserve (NAP) beyond it are only open to hikers. Respect the special forest and the plant and animal species it protects by following LNT practices. The trail descends to a saddle, where a sign indicates the NAP. It then climbs a series of switchbacks along the lower portion of the ridge before coming out on top, where the views are spectacular in all directions. Look back and note the Quartz Mountain Lookout peeking out above the trees on Quartz Mountain; look to the south to see Newman Lake looking close enough to dive into; to the east, see numerous Idaho Lakes. The trail continues out to the edge of the NAP, where a fence marks a boundary that is slightly on the Idaho side of the border; here is where Mount Spokane State Park crosses state boundaries, even if only a little bit. Turn back here and retrace the route for a round trip hike of 15.1 miles. ** Note that bikes and horses are prohibited in the Natural Area Preserve. Signs indicate where horses and bikes are allowed. ** Hike Description Written by Holly Weiler, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"Every winter I wait for the perfect conditions for a Ragged Ridge trip! It doesn't often happen: it's only accessible via ski trails but it's off the groomed trail system. It needs to have fresh snow + cold enough conditions for powder + a sunny day since it's a long approach that's most worthwhile when there are views. Today was the day! It was absolutely gorgeous out there. Selkirk Lodge/the parking lot/and close-in Nordic trails were VERY busy today with the junior ski races happening this weekend, but once we were out on the trail to Ragged Ridge we had the only tracks save for the resident moose and some snowshoe hares. Today was also day #4 in a row for visiting my backyard trails, and I already have plans to be back up there tomorrow! Mount Spokane is amazing for being super close while still having a total backcountry feel. That's especially true of Ragged Ridge, a protected Natural Area within the park. #LoveLocalTrails #WTAStaff",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's a nice network of trails. We started from the West Trailhead and followed what was called The Emerald Necklace. We used Organic Maps (Open Street Map app) and did a nice loop of the necklace that culminated with the peak, which isn't particularly interesting but a nice pause amidst the trail. Lots of signs of wildlife but we didn't see any aside from a single raven. Might make a great snowshoe trail in the wintertime.",,,,"3,366 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Antoine Peak Conservation Area Acquired in four phases through Spokane County’s Conservation Futures Program, with additional funding secured through the Washington State Recreation and Conservation Office, the Antoine Peak Conservation Area consists of 1296 acres of conservation land and offers fantastic views overlooking Liberty Lake, the Spokane Valley, and north to Mount Spokane and the Selkirk Range. The trail system consists of old logging roads converted to trails and newly constructed single track. Demonstrating the Conservation Futures Program’s commitment to benefiting wildlife, conserving natural resources, and improving opportunities for passive recreation in Spokane County, the Conservation Area is home to numerous wildlife and plant species. Hikers, snowshoers, skiers, birders, mountain bikers and equestrian users alike could potentially spot red-tail hawk soaring overhead, listen to pileated woodpeckers at work on surrounding trees, come across signs of the resident white-tailed deer, moose, and elk populations, or spot such locally rare trees as Pacific yew. Through additions and improvements over the years, there are now three different access points for the trail network on Antoine Peak. The west side access at Brevier Road offers the most direct route to the summit of Antione Peak, as well as the quickest connection to the Emerald Necklace route that travels around the base of the peak at approximately the 3000-foot level. This access point offers the best views of the Spokane Valley. From the trailhead visitors can choose to follow either the communications tower access road in the trees or a single-track trail crisscrossing a west-facing meadow as it climbs for just under a mile to an overlook. Royal Riblet’s Mansion, home of Arbor Crest Winery, is visible on the cliff overlooking the Spokane River to the southwest; Peone Prairie and its checkerboard of agricultural land lies to the northwest. Continue up trail to the first intersection and veer right for the Emerald Necklace loop, for a total of just over five miles round-trip and views of the east Spokane Valley all the way to Liberty Lake. The west side of the mountain is transformed into a sea of gold in the early spring, when arrowleaf balsamroot cover the hillsides on this generally dry side of the mountain. Adjacent to the trail, watch for rocky mountain junipers popping up among the larger Ponderosa pines and fir trees. For those who would prefer to summit rather than take the round-the-mountain route, veer left at the intersection and continue uphill just under half a mile along the old roadbed that also accesses the communications towers on the summit. At the second intersection, turn right and continue uphill for a half-mile to the summit; the left- hand trail is the return route for the Emerald Necklace loop. This route is also frequently traveled by workers accessing the communication towers at the summit, so watch for vehicles along the way. For those who access the property from the east at Canfield Gulch off Lincoln Road, the options consist of a longer, more gradual ascent via an old logging road converted to trail, or a slightly steeper single track option. Both connect to the Emerald Necklace at a main intersection, and then continue to ascend via single track to the summit of Antoine Peak. The old logging road option that leads northwest from the parking area passes Leland Pond enroute, offering the best chance for spotting a moose. The trails on this side of the peak follow the small streams that feed the pond, where hikers can view rare Pacific yew trees. Increased moisture on this side of the mountain yields increased diversity in plant life. In the spring, watch for trillium and shooting stars along seasonal seeps, giving way to lupine blooms and Indian paintbrush later in the season. The most recent addition to the Conservation Area is the Etter Ranch property, with a trailhead located in the Spokane Valley at Wellesley and Flora. Acquired in 2019 with the trailhead opening in 2021, trails here are still under construction. The completed Arrowleaf Trail is the main connector leading to the Emerald Necklace, with nearby Lost Apple Trail serving as a shorter and lower elevation option. Toilet Information Toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Wheelchair Accessibility Since several of the trails at Antoine Peak are converted road beds, portions of the Antoine Peak trail system can be accessed via wheelchair. Please note that none of the trails here are built to ADA standards, and visitors can expect steeper grades in some areas and varied surfaces. WTA worked here in 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021!

We could see them munching across the sea weeds with our binoculars. There were also interesting, loud, black birds with red beaks, which we were told later were oyster catchers. The Iceberg point trail had wonderful scenery and felt the most peaceful. We finished at Watmough bay, ascending to Chadwick Hill for the views and then connecting to Point Colville via Watmough Hill. We returned through the road as the Watmough Hill part was fun to do once but didn't seem entertaining enough for a second pass at it. The trails were all dry and there were many ripe salmonberry bushes at the shark reef trailhead. We saw very few people in the morning. The only place that started to be a bit crowded was the Watmough bay area past noon. Fortunately we got some alone time at the top swing on Chadwick Hill. This was a great way to discover the island.

It's one of my favorite areas to visit in the fall and winter where you can immerse yourself in the quiet forest and enjoy the misty views along the river. I stopped by the Carbon River Ranger station on my way in to chat with the rangers and get an update on the bridges over the Carbon River heading out to the falls. If you're visiting the park for the first time or are not sure what current conditions are in the park, I definitely recommend stopping at one of the ranger stations/visitor centers. Staff there generally have the most up-to-date info and are happy to recommend hikes that will work well for you and your group's interests, gear and abilities. The bathrooms at the parking area were in great shape, fully stocked and very clean. There was plenty of parking on this rainy morning. There were lots of brochures and trail maps in the box at the info sign; be sure to grab one if you're unfamiliar with the area. I visited the Old Mine trail on my way to the falls. The trail was in great shape and worth the side trip. It's steep with a few large steps to navigate but only 0.3 miles. There is currently a large pile of gravel in front of the trailhead, making it a bit difficult to spot. You can walk behind the gravel pile and from there the trail should be obvious. The trail to the falls was generally in good shape, with some wet muddy areas to go through so waterproof boots were definitely helpful. All four bridges over the river to the falls were still in and in good condition. The trail across the river bed was clear and easy to follow without needing cairns. Before I left, I checked out the Rainforest Nature trail, a short loop that leaves right from the parking area behind the information board. WTA and park trail crews did great work this summer replacing some of the rotting boards, making the trail much easier to navigate. If you head left on the loop, you'll encounter the new boardwalks. If you head right, you'll still need to cross older boardwalks with boards missing/damaged in many areas. If you'd like to avoid that, an out and back hike along the left side is a great option. I passed about 15 people all day, all on the main Carbon River road trail. Just a reminder to travel carefully when heading to this section of the park, I had a deer bolt in front of my car just before the ranger station and a few months ago the same thing happened with an elk in the same area.",,,,"2,150 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"46.9832 , -121.8381 Map & Directions",,,,,,"Hiking Old Mine Trail An infrequently-visited trail off the Carbon River Road, the Old Mine Trail follows a short but steep roadbed to a mineshaft. It's a good outing for kids, if they're willing to make the short push up the steep section. Just past the Carbon River Ranger Station, at the northwest entrance to Mount Rainier National Park, park your car and make your way down the flat, wide road converted to trail surrounded by greenery and the rushing of the river. After a bit more than a mile of hiking, look for a trail off to your right. This is the route to the Old Mine, a steep push through close forests of Western Washington's signature western red cedar, Douglas fir, swordfern and fluffy moss. Luckily, the surroundings and the shortness of this uphill push make it bearable -- after just 0.3 miles you'll arrive at the mineshaft. A hole in the hillside framed with ferns, the mine entrance is gated about a hundred feet in, so kids and curious adults can explore a bit in relative safety. There are some beat-up tracks, marking the beginning of the carts' journey into the earth to extract ore. Look around the immediate area for other signs of human activity. Stumps and newer trees indicate areas that may have been cleared in the past as staging platforms for the exploratory mine activity. WTA worked here in 2013!

We were looking for a shorter hike, so we walked to our lunch spot near the river. The road is really easy to walk. It's flat the entire way, which makes it a really easy day!

First: This has been an atypical, last two and half months.  From mid-October to mid-November, there were great snow storms above 4,000 feet (occasionally, in a promising fashion, lower).  Even in very early December, Washington and Rainy Passes and Highway 20 were open and the valley was snow free), then the warm rains began, Highway 20 was closed and even the higher elevation snow began to melt.  There were floods on the west side of the Cascades and rivers on the east side rose to flood levels. US 2 was closed.  In the 13 years that I have been hiking the Spokane Gulch trail, the e phemeral stream, which the trail crosses some 9 times, only flows during periods of rapid spring snow melt.  During these series of mild, atmospheric rivers, this ephemeral stream had volumes of water coming down the hill. A December 17th hike up Sagebrush and Flagg mountain, three days after peak flows on the Methow, this ephemeral stream had sufficient volume that each trail crossing required some careful foot work to avoid getting wet.  This was true all the way to above the junction with the Flagg Mountain trail. Yesterday, when we did this hike, there was still plenty of water flowing -- you could actually hear it before you saw it.  In the mid-summer to early March, I have never hiked the Spokane Gulch trail when there is water flowing in this stream.  Walking up the snow-covered trail (well over a foot in the valley and approaching two feet on the bench leading to the lookout point[s]) and dealing with flowing water was a new, but interesting experience! There was a second issue: this long, gray, wet, the mild fall ended about 8 or 9 days ago when a series of snow storms consistently reached at or below the 1,800 foot level.  This unusually high water content snow coated the trees and cold nights further cemented the snow on the trees, especially those near the valley floor.  Snow loads became so great that trees (generally those with poor diameter to height ratios and mostly ponderosa pine, bent over, bowed in some cases almost forming a shepherd's crook and then suddenly snapping at the base of the live crown. Some broke near ground level, some up-rooted [especially Douglas-fir]). I can walk out to the back porch of where we are staying and see 15 broken or up-rooted trees.  So the first part of the Spokane Gulch trail goes through this forested zone where trees were breaking or up-rooting.  It was an initial concern, but we encountered only one new tree across the trail (easily crossed).  This issue was not present in the forest reached in the upper third of this trail. The four of us and our one dog all enjoyed this hike and recommend it.  Right now there is a broken trail.  We used spikes, but I don't think those are critical now -- I like the sure-footed aspect they provide.",,,,"3,100 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Spokane Gulch A trail ascending from the Methow valley floor towards Goat Wall, Spokane Gulch is a local favorite. Trails and roads continue on up to Flagg Mountain to the south or Goat Peak's lookout 4000 feet above the valley floor. From a historian’s perspective, there is much to see along this trail. The modern day hiker will enjoy its diverse geology, seasonal changes, and wide-open views of the Upper Methow Valley. Open to hiking year-round makes viewing seasonal changes a real joy. The first half mile of trail cuts across the meadow east of Mazama’s center. The recently improved Corral Parking area is your trailhead. There are privies available here. Hike towards the base of the mountain housing the fire lookout atop Goat Peak. After a half mile, cross a dirt road and enter the woods. At the roads’ edge you will find signs for Spokane Gulch’s old trailhead. Entering the woods, the trail winds up, down, and around through small talus slopes, cliff bands, and occasional dry drainages. The first non-native users of this hillside were likely miners, and lining this route are remnants of those years gone by. A sharp eye reveals adits and prospects at several locations. The miners’ dreams of riches never materialized here nor at most of the areas’ mines. By the mid 1920s the US Forest Service was busy putting fire lookouts atop every viable highpoint throughout the west. Goat Peak, high above your head, got its first lookout in 1924. Access to the lookout back then, was the trail you're on, but today, this lookout is best reached via the Goat Peak Lookout Trail. The Spokane Gulch Trail today gains roughly 1100 feet in two miles (though most of that gain is in just one mile). At 3100 feet of elevation, the trail turns abruptly to the left (signed) onto an old logging road. From here the views improve, offering continuous sights of the Methow Valley, the eastern North Cascades, and the Paysaten Wilderness. At about two miles you will reach the end of the established trail. Dubbed by locals Sagebrush Flats, the climate in this landscape creates a mixed sagebrush steppe. Springtime brings flowers, and summertime the fragrance of sage. In wintertime, though the route is under snow, the trail is frequently broken to this point. WTA Pro Tip: When you return to the trail head, remain parked there and walk over to the Mazama Store. Baked goods or a frosty pint enjoyed in their airy courtyard is hard to beat. If you’re looking for car camping there are two nearby state parks, and many national forest campgrounds as well. Toilet Information Toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Hike Description Written by Austin Smith , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,We’ve been hiking Spokane Gulch and skiing Mazama’s trails all week! The coverage has been pretty damn amazing despite low snowfall😊 We are hoping for a little more tonight. Basecamp is open but skate only and it ends at the Bush School.

We went all the way around West Tiger without hitting any of the summits. This was about 12 miles with somewhere between 2200-2500' of elevation gain. We took a side trip to Poo Poo Point along the way - this adds 1.2 miles and about 250' of elevation. ROUTE : To be fair, it's not a complete loop, since we did not walk the connector trail and road back to our cars at the end. We started at the Tradition Plateau Trailhead and took the Bus Trail, then the Poo Poo Point Trail over to Poo Poo Point. From there, we returned back to the One View Trail and climbed that all the way to the junction with the TMT. We followed the TMT to where it crossed the 15 Mile Railroad Grade. This is really one of the nicer sections of the TMT, and tends to be drier than what you find on the north side. We then followed the 15 Mile Railroad Grade NE, where it crosses the Main Tiger Mountain Road and then becomes the ""Bootleg Connector Trail"". It used to be called the ""Paw Print Connector"" after the old rest stop next to the road, but apparently the name is changing. Upon reaching the Bootleg Trail, we followed that to its end at the Preston Trail, then took the Preston Trail down to Dwight's Way. We took Dwight's Way west to the Lingering Trail, following that down to the High Point Trail, past the nice bench at the Trail Dragon (don't miss it!). We then took the High Point Trail back to our cars waiting at the bottom, and drove to pick up our other car at Tradition Plateau. SPRING FLOWERS : It's still pretty early spring on Tiger Mountain and not a lot is out at elevation. The yellow violets and trillium are blooming pretty well, and the elderberry and salmonberry are all sprouting. There is a lot of Palmate Coltsfoot just starting to bloom where the 15 Mile Railroad Grade crosses the Tiger Mountain Road. Other than that, I'd say wait 3-4 weeks for all the ferns to start sprouting, and more of the perennials plants and flowers will be out. BLOWDOWNS : Thanks to the trail crews who cleared all the blowdowns on the One View Trail and the Lingering Trail! There are new blowdowns in the following locations: 1) Tiger Mountain Trail, just above where it crosses the 15 Mile Railroad Grade - a vine maple with about a dozen trunks fell across two parts of the trail at a switchback, and 2) Bootleg Trail, just inside the NRCA boundary at about 2050' - these are fairly minor and rotten, so could maybe be taken care of without a saw. MUD : Mud was a recurring theme today, as it had been raining most of the morning. The worst mud was on the One View Trail below the vine maple arch, then again before reaching 15 Mile Gap, then on the Bootleg Trail in the usual spot around 1800'. I wore my trail runners for the whole hike, but they were somewhat soggy by the end. On a warm sunny day, the mud would be a non-issue. PEOPLE : Almost all the people we saw today were on the Poo Poo Point Trail - about 10 perhaps. We saw two trail runners on One View up by 15 Mile Gap, but other than that we saw no one else until one party coming up the bottom of the High Point Trail. This route is sort of the ""hind end"" of Tiger Mountain, but the trails are in really nice shape and it is a great place for some quiet forest walking.",,,,"2,200 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Paw Print Connector A connector trail on Tiger Mountain.

The hike along the road is mostly flat with a little ups and downs, until you come upon Steeple Rock, where avalanche risk is not unheard of. Check with the visitor's center before you start the hike to ensure that it's safe to hike the road. The road to Steeple Rock is uphill, narrow and very windy.

I took snowshoes but did not need them for deer ridge. It was surprisingly snowless until a bit before the camp. Road for deer ridge was clear driving in (just Potholes) and trail was in great conditions. I didn't realize that road for the deer camp must not be used, it was so picture perfect when I arrived, it hadn't been touched since the snowfall. At the camp the snow is just ~shoe high Because I made good timing I decided to continue on to Obstruction point with Maiden as a goal. I once again didn't need snowshoes until perhaps just pass half way to Maiden. The snow became tiresome at perhaps 1700m, and then became progressively more tiresome. All but one strap on my snowshoes ruptured, thus the ""tiresome"", speaking from someone that is still healing from a torn labrum...oops. I started to wonder about avalanche possibilities around 1800m just before the 1926m point, there is one sloppy and bare section to cross (sorry, all my maps are metric). I bailed on the Maiden idea because the going became too slow so I tried for the point. I picked a terrible line and hope nobody will see my postholing disgrace. So I turned around a few meters from the top because although the snow felt it would hold me. Everything beneath me was a mystery, I am was mostly on what felt like slabby rock or buried trees and I did not like that too much. On the way back I went up to Blue mountain and that was really nice. I've spent so long in the cascades that I forget you can see the ocean so close! Also a very cute family of deer calling camp their home. On the way down I realized I didn't appreciate how nice the upper section of the deer ridge was.

And judging by how fast camping permits are snatched up for this area, it’s no secret. This trail can be engaged from a variety of starting points depending on time and interest. One popular starting point is the Wonderland Trail at Box Canyon, 10 miles west of the Stevens Canyon Entrance. The first mile is a moderate trek northeast to the Nickel Creek wilderness camp, followed by a vigorous 2,000-foot climb to the crest of the Cowlitz Divide. The trail undulates along the divide, meadows widening the higher you go, and eventually gains another 500 feet to views of Double and Shriner Peaks to the east and The Mountain rising immediately to the west. The trail then drops a quick 800 feet into the valley of the Ohanapecosh River and the wide meadows of Indian Bar. In early summer, numerous waterfalls stream down the walls of the valley, fed by the glaciers above. This makes a good halfway point before starting the next climb. From Indian Bar, the trail continues north, steeply climbing over 1,500 feet in the next 1.5 miles. It then levels somewhat while traversing the meadows of Ohanapecosh Park to the high point on the Wonderland: Panhandle Gap at 6,800 feet. Here you’ll find yourself in the alpine zone, a landscape dominated by rocky talus that often holds snow through the summer months. Rangers and guidebooks issue warnings about traversing the snowfields here in bad weather, so exercise caution and good judgement. This is a common location to spot mountain goats, and the Cowlitz Chimneys can be viewed to the east. From the gap, the trail descends 1.5 miles to the Summerland wilderness camp along Fryingpan Creek. Little Tahoma rises sharply above wide meadows brimming with wildflowers, and Goat Island Mountain dominates to the north. The route then descends steadily along Fryingpan Creek 4 miles to the trailhead at Sunrise Road. Extend Your Hike: Consider camping at one or more of the four campsites in the area: Nickel Creek (four sites), Olallie Creek, Indian Bar (five sites, one group site), and Summerland (six sites). It can be tough to get permits at these campsites due to the area’s popularity and the fact that you’ll be competing with weekend hikers as well as advance-planning Wonderland Trail hikers for the handful of wilderness campsites available through this section. To improve your chances of scoring a permit and savoring this idyllic location, consider a midweek trip. Hike Description Written by Eli Boschetto, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"We weren't lucky enough to get Wonderland permits in the lottery this year, but managed to secure a short notice overnight permit from a cancellation. Easy drive in through the Sunrise entrance. We got to the park around 8:30AM and were able to drive right up to the gate, then immediately pick up permits at the ranger station. Frying Pan Creek trailhead was maybe 10 minutes down the road from the ranger station. Parking was full at the creek, but we parked on the side of the road close by at the ranger's suggestion. Start to finish the trail was in great shape. Heading from the trailhead to the Panhandle Gap, the climb is pretty steady with a couple spicier sections thrown in. Up until Summerland, the trail was a lovely, smooth, packed dirt. Between Summerland and the gap, the trail transitioned into a rock field until we started descending towards Indian Bar. The descent was steep but not technical, and a little brushy at times. The trail goes over several rivers/streams, and all of them were crossable without getting your feet wet. Water was easy to come by for filtering through almost all of the trail. On day 1, the views were incredible. Fun mushrooms poking up in the forest, raging streams and waterfalls, colorful sub-alpine meadows, and looming snow peaks in the background. Tons of ripe and delicious blueberries, particularly around Indian Bar. It started raining by the time we woke up on day 2, and kept going for our entire hike out.  The initial climb out of Indian Bar left us with wet pants and shoes from the tighter brush sections. The trail handled the rain well and some of the dustier sections, like the descent into Indian Bar, firmed up and had really good traction. It made the climb out feel as good as a 1800' climb in the rain could. Some of the rock sections were a little slick, but everything was manageable. The descent back to the trailhead generally went quickly. Trail traffic was pretty light, and we mostly ran into hikers doing the full Wonderland loop. Hike stats according to my watch:  Per usual, the campsites were fantastic in the national park. All of the individual sites were spacious, flat, and had soft dirt for staking. There was a bear pole for hangs, or leaving bear cans at the base. The individual campsite toilet was full, and closed by the rangers, but the group site toilet was still available and clean with plenty of room left. We ran into a couple rangers who were out checking permits. They warned us about a bear that had been close to the sites recently and said that we might encounter some elk as it's rutting season. Lots of chipmunks, and pika along the way. Near Indian Bar we saw 12-15 mountain goats, 2 on trail, and a handsome black bear in the meadow next to the camp sites who was much more interested in blueberries than people. We think we heard him romping around in the trees between the individual campsites. I thought that I heard some elks bugling in the morning but I did not see any. We also saw several joy-sparking american dippers in the river near camp. The flowers along the way were beautiful, the berries were ripe, and the rocks were surprisingly colorful. During the rain, some of the colors really came through and the gap turned into a stunning display of reds, greens, and blues in the rock. A few of the larger rock surfaces almost had a stained glass look from all of the different deposits in them. This hike is one of the prettier ones in Washington from start to finish. There's a fantastic mix of forest, meadows, peaks, and waterfalls that's tough to find anywhere else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up high as the trailhead crosses a talus field there are some nice views of Dog Mountain, and even caught a glimpse of I believe Mount Adams. The summit area had some signs posted that there were some Tribal Sacred Lands on the summit, and there were some rock features and pits dug in the talus done by the tribal ancestors. In the west side of the summit were some nice views looking down to the Columbia River Gorge. We could also see Beacon Rock which we did the previous day after hiking up Dog Mountain, along with Mount Saint Helens. Fun hike to end our long weekend exploring the Columbia River Gorge area!

Skiers- you can start skinning about 2.8 miles in but it’s kind of awful for a while until you get closer to the basin. Snow bridge over the Inter Fork of the White River is there but going fast if you want to ski the Inter Glacier. Nice corn around 10/11am today! You’ll see our long glissade track from Camp Curtis. We hiked the Glacier Basin Trail to climb Mount Rainier, entering 5/27/25 and exiting 5/30/25. The trail is snow-free for the first mile then intermittently snow-covered for a short stretch then continuously snow-covered to the Glacier Basin meadows area. The snow is covered with pine needles, branches, and other organic debris… plus lumpy with some cavities over hollow spaces to watch out for and some treacherous spots where you could punch through the snow. There are 2 spots where the trail’s bridges aren’t fully accessible due to snow so you have to cross running streams on tricky snow bridges- which will only get sketchier as the snow melts. As you approach the end of the trail there’s a set of footprints that wander off route so keep that in mind! Easy to collect water from the river once you reach the Glacier Basin meadows area (totally under snow of course right now). Camp Schurman- one bathroom open and you can drop off your human waste bags in the barrel by the bathrooms. Lots of snow still there - see pictures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Camp Schurman,,,,,,,,"Summited Tahoma via the Emmons route 7/6/25. Trip lasted 3 days in total, the first of which being a hike-in to Camp Schurman, followed by summit day, and then finally the hike out. Although we were warned about crevasses appearing at the top of the Interglacier, we didn't see any. The scramble section down from the Interglacier to the Emmons was a little spicy with a heavy pack; the climbing ranger told us this has been the case in recent years due to melt out. A couple members of our group expressed surprise at the difference compared to the last time they climbed this route. The climb from Camp Schurman to the Summit was not bad, other than a stiff wind in the late morning (was wearing all of my layers) followed by scorching heat on the way down (was in a single layer by this point). We left around 12:30-1 am and hit the summit around 8 am. I believe we made it back to Camp Schurman around 1 or 1:30 pm, with our pace slightly slowed due to members of our team having altitude sickness. Be aware that the Alpine Meadow section (above The Corridor) gets dicey once the snow bridges soften in the mid-day sun; someone on another rope team punched through just ahead of us. All in all, this was a fun adventure. Nothing beats the sunsets at Camp Schurman, and we appreciated the good tent sites and welcoming climbing rangers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"46.9003 , -121.6581 Map & Directions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To get there you first have to climb Mailbox, so a couple of thoughts about that: I went up the old trail. This was a nice day for the old trail as the recent rain had dampened down all the dust and loose soil. That made for an easy ascent. It also brought out some mushrooms which were fun to see. I got to meet a nice search and rescue dog at the top too. Dirtybox Peak is the first peak to the east when you're standing at the mailbox. It requires some class 2 scrambling, a bit of bushwhacking, and especially route finding skills - GPS will only get you so far with this one. It probably goes without saying, but it's wise to be super comfortable with Mailbox before tackling this. The first part is a down-scramble to the ridge. Today this was dry, so pretty simple. There's some mild exposure and a little bit of route finding, but it's fairly clear where the trail goes. (Third pic is from the bottom of this part looking back up at Mailbox.) I find the middle of the ridge is the hardest part as the trail sometimes seems to disappear into the pines. There's a trail under there though. If you part the brush you can see it. If you can't see it or the brush seems impenetrable, chances are the trail has skipped back up to the ridge. There are a couple of rocky prominences with great views along the way which could make a good enough destination. There's only one part with serious exposure, but you're a little bit back from the edge. Today there was a lot of moisture on the branches, so I got fairly wet going through this part. It felt good though after climbing Mailbox. The last part is a lightly trodden, but somewhat clear trail through the woods up to the peak. Today there was a blow down just ten feet from the peak. It's an annoying one to cross, but totally worth the effort as there's a really nice flat rock at the top to sit on. Views are mostly south, but you can see the area around Thompson Point and Granite Lakes through the trees. There's a summit register in an ammo box. Overall Dirtybox Peak is a super fun obstacle course type hike. It's also a way to get more solitude than the main Mailbox summit. Some other stats: only saw three people on the old Mailbox trail. I saw around ten people on the other parts of Mailbox and at the summit. There was no one on the Dirtybox trail. Total elevation gain for this hike was right around 4200'. Old Mailbox to Dirtybox and back down came in at 8.2 miles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Dirtybox Peak If Mailbox Peak hasn't totally drained you, head along the ridge to the east up to Dirtybox Peak. The trail takes hikers through brush and over rocks, some of which may require some scrambling. Entering deep brush, the trail fades, at times disappearing completely. But stay on the ridge spine, and soon enter a forested section. Keeping in view of I-90, make your way up the shady hillside. Arrive at the summit, marked by a large rock nestled in trees. Take a well-deserved rest, and enjoy a view of Mailbox seldom seen. Further views of Mailbox, as well as Dirty Harry's Peak, Bandera Mountain, and Webb Mountain are possible by continuing east, but keep in mind that at this point the scramble becomes more dangerous, with several sections where a fall could be fatal. Experience is highly recommended for anyone exploring further.",,,,,,,,"I went up the old trail, along the ridge to Dirtybox and back, then down the new trail. I haven’t done Mailbox since 2018. After reading a lot recently about the number of emergency services calls for people needing help on this trail, I decided on a revisit. I had never done the new trail so I wanted to have a look at that. Apparently, the old trail hasn’t been maintained since the new one was made in 2014 but there is so much hiker traffic that it’s become a supercharged boot path. That makes it easy to follow on the way up, but every hiker I met coming down was off the trail. Years of trail runners coming down quickly have extended all the false trails to make a rats’ nest of eroded soil tracks. The trail doesn’t seem like a huge injury hazard: Gunn Peak and the Kamikaze Trail are harder. What seems like the most difficult part starts at the scree after the old and the new trails join together when they meet at the end of the trees. From then on, the views are fabulous. The summit of Mailbox Peak has an ever-changing population of lunching hikers and hence a lot of Gray Jays.  Dirtybox Peak looks temptingly accessible along a half-mile ridge to the east. It’s not a difficult traverse, especially with AllTrails giving me a route. There’s a scramble down from Mailbox to the saddle that has some class 3 moves. However, in late November this is made harder by the ice that lingers until after midday. Because it’s a lightly used route, the trail is through densely-packed conifers. Squeezing through these gives you a constant wetting with ice-cold water. Still, it’s easy. There’s no real view from the summit of Dirtybox because of the trees, and absolutely no people or Gray Jays. I wanted to keep going along the ridge to Dirty Harry’s Peak, but it really didn’t look inviting, so I headed back to Mailbox. I decided to check out the new trail on the way down. It’s well-made and has no steep parts. It’s great for mycophiles because of the huge diversity of fungi along the whole trail. It has some sections that rival Hoh Rainforest for mossy grandeur. There are two beautifully constructed bridges. The problem is that few people seem to use it. It’s so much longer than the steep, muddy maze of the old trail. It took me a lot more time to go down than it did to get up, and with 4000 feet of elevation gain and loss, that shouldn’t be the case. There were people starting on the new trail after 2:30pm with absolutely no hope of making it to the summit and back before darkness. There is a warning sign at the start of the old trail about the duration of the hike, but not on the new trail. Maybe that needs to change.

In spring, water is diverted from Mill Creek to the lake after the snowmelt has slowed and the lake is less likely to flood. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife stocks rainbow trout in the lake, and anglers flock for several relaxing hours of fishing. The Sun and Sage National Birding Trail is also here, and a huge variety of birds live here year round, or come through on their yearly migration. There are more than 20 miles of trails at Bennington Lake, whether you want a long perimeter walk, or just a quick out and back for views of the lake. The Whitetail Trail is the longest, clocking in at 4.8 mile, with moderate elevation gain. Wind along an old road bed on the west side of the lake, then descend just a few feet to meet the Meadowlark Trail as it follows the diversion canal closely. Along the way, you'll get an up-close look at both native and non-native plants and animals, but won't see quite as much water. The Meadowlark Trail (2.6 miles) stays closer to the lake and the feeder stream, crossing the diversion canal at the south end using small rock steps. You can simply slosh through the water -- a refreshing respite on a particularly hot day. From here, link up with the Whitetail Trail, which continues up to the north end of the canal and crosses there, adding about a quarter mile to your total distance. From the north end, the Whitetail Trail heads to the south end of the diversion canal, then begins zigzagging along the property line, while the Meadowlark Trail sticks closer to the stream that feeds Bennington Lake. Alternately, the Kingfisher Trail is just 1.7 miles, and follows a moderate grade along the north and south sides of Mill Creek itself.

We left trailhead at 6:05am.  Arrived to Marmot Lake ~945am and Jade Lake ~11am.  Marmot Lake was prettier than I thought it would be.  Trail from Marmot to Jade wasn't too bad.  Air temp. was warm, probably in the 80s by 11am, so I'm glad we started early.  We jumped in icy Jade Lake, probably 40 degrees (refreshing, but we didn't last long) and Marmot Lake on way out (probably in low 50s) where we stayed in the water for 20 minutes to cool off.  Marmot felt like a bath tub compared to Jade. From Jade Lake, Recommendation #1, after the campgrounds, follow trail above the shoreline and turn right just before the last tree grove and scramble fairly easily down a ""hiker's trail"" near the head of the lake.  Don't do what we did which was to go left of the upper tree grove, and traverse the scree slope above the snowfield.  It was nasty traversing the scree slope, and I bloodied myself a few times.  There isn't much exposure, but the rocks move underneath you each step.  On the way back, we smartly followed the lakeshore and hiked up the scramble trail. Recommendation #2, bring microspikes (this time of year) for the snowfield up Dip Top Gap.  Microspikes worked well.  Crampons or poles would have been nice, but I didn't want to carry the weight.  Ice axe would be overkill. ""Summitted"" Dip Top Gap for splendid view of Mt. Daniel and Pea Soup Lake.  We saw Glacier Peak and Mt. Baker too.  Recommendation #3, bring light goretex pants for the glissade down.  We had an awesome glissade from Dip Top to nearly Jade Lake.  Recommendation #4, bring bug juice.  I'm scratching at nearly 100 bug bites today.  Worst was in the morning after Deception Pass (near several ponds breeding grounds), Marmot Lake and Jade Lake.  Half the people were wearing mosquito nets.  We returned to the trailhead at 8pm. Jade Lake and Dip Top Gap are totally worth it.  Next time, I might bring a tent and stay at Marmot Lake.  Doing this in 1 day was a lot for me, and my body is paying for it today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Pea Soup Lake,,,,,,,,"We did a day hike up to Dip Top Gap and then climbed up to Dip Top Peak. The trail is in great shape until Marmot Lake. Once you reach Marmot Lake the trail becomes narrow with many down trees. It's really hard to follow the right trail to Jade Lake but just be prepared for scree and a climbing over a few boulders. Going around Jade Lake is fairly straight forward until you reach a junction with one trail going up and another dropping steeply to the shoreline. Take the trail that descends to the rocky shoreline and then do you best to follow cairns to the bottom of the snowfield. The snowfield was in good condition but within a week or two it will become icy, and crampons will be very helpful. At Dip Top Gap head right up some rock slabs and eventually you will find a faint trail which goes part way up Dip Top Peak. It's mostly class 2/3 but at the very top there is a narrow 25ft section with huge drop-offs on both sides. Took us 13 hours or so roundtrip. The mosquitos were annoying but not bad with the exception of Jade Lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I followed fresh goat tracks and checked the map a couple times to keep close to the trail. It was a hot day so the snow was soft and post holing was a concern, with even the goats popping through. Fortunately I could see their post holes and knew to tread lightly. Near the top there multiple small cornices along the cliff edge so I was sure to keep far away from the ridge line. No snow on the summit outcropping and a beautiful view. The goats were hanging around but none were aggressive.

With more than 1,000 feet gained per mile, it is one tough training hike, but it is well-worth the effort it takes to get to the top. Long-proposed for protection as part of the Scotchman Peak Wilderness, this is a very wild area that's still easily accessible. The trail is undergoing improvements to its too-steep grade, so the round trip mileage will eventually be a bit longer. There's nothing to be done about the elevation gain, which is actually more in the winter when the TH is inaccessible and intrepid snowshoers and backcountry skiers must start a little lower down and closer to town. Check avy conditions before a winter visit. The beginning of the hike is in a recovering forest with few views, so watch for the local flora and fauna instead. Spring wildflowers eventually give way to summer huckleberries along the route. Approximately two-thirds of the way up, the trail leaves the trees and enters a rocky section. The views are impressive, with Lake Pend Oreille shimmering far below and other peaks all around. At the summit, site of an old fire lookout, keep an eye out for Mr. Scotchman (actually any number of local mountain goats). Please don't feed or approach the goats! The trail was closed for a time in the summer of 2015 due to habituated goats. Keep dogs on leash and keep all food stowed safely in your pack. Keep your pack on or nearby as well, as the goats will attempt to lick salt off the straps of unattended packs.

Since we knew from experience that the road does go past lots of Lewisia, we continued on. Instead of a partly overgrown, green and leafy road, we found the road has been bulldozed so that it could be driven if the gate were open. Definitely cut down on the charm of the hike. The peak for Lewisia has passed but we did find many up at the ridge top at 3200 ft, along with Lewisia Rediviva, maricopa lilies, lupine, etc. And bear scat, some fairly fresh, so we made lots of noise. Using the old logging roads, you can explore and make loops. After 7 miles RT/1600ft gain we were ready for dinner at Yodelin in Leavenworth.

There are no official trails in this area. Visitors are strongly encouraged to tread lightly here, since at least one species of these rare plants have not been documented anywhere else.",,,,"47.6524 , -120.7253 Map & Directions",,,,"With the spring wildflower season rapidly drawing to a close at low elevation, I was hoping to find a few more new species on my ""must-see"" list of wildflowers, this time on Tumwater Mountain.  In addition to the beautiful, but more widespread lupines, balsamroot, phlox and buckwheats, Tumwater has some rare ones. The UW Herbarium has in its collection a number of specimens of at least five different rare species from this mountain.  One of them is showy stickseed (Hackelia venusta), which somewhat resembles a very large white forget-me-not.  The story goes that one day, a group of graduate students went collecting plants for the introductory botany lab at the University of Washington and unknowingly wiped out the roadside population of this plant along SR 2 at the base of Tumwater Mountain.  While I cannot swear that there are no plants left along the highway, every time I have stopped to examine the white flowers along the roadside, they are always buckwheat, phlox, yarrow or spiraea.  Several years ago, I parked alongside the highway, climbed straight up to the top, came down the other side, walked through Leavenworth and back along the highway in search of this and several other rare species (including wild peonies and several orchids). I had a great day, but found none of the species I was looking for.  Part of the way up I found a trail, with switchbacks, but because I did a loop trip, I never found out where it began.  In spite of stopping at every pull-out along that highway at the base of Tumwater Mt. (there are at least 18), I have not found it since.  It did not go all the way to the top, but it went up a good bit of the climb.  This is by way of background. According to the WTA website, the Tumwater Botanical Area ""trail"" starts at FR 7903.  However at this time there is a hand-written sign at the gate that says the Tumwater Botanical Area is not here, but at mile post 96.  I believed this sign, because according to my Green Trails map, the actual botanical reserve boundaries do not intersect with FR 7903 or those roads that branch off from it.  Nevertheless, I thought it was still worth exploring.  While I was sitting at the gate keying out a small, inconspicuous flower I found there, a truck pulled up, opened the gate and drove on.  The gate is not locked and the driver apparently already knew that.  This road has been recently bulldozed, which has me a little worried.  Access to the wild lands in most of the canyons in the area is blocked by private property-no trespassing signs.  Why else would a closed road be improved unless they were planning some development or logging in the area?  The area is not protected.  FR 7903 has pretty good floral diversity.  There's an especially nice display of orange honeysuckle in bloom.  But I did not find exactly what I was looking for and turned around at about three miles.  On the way down, I found a friendly Western Yellowbelly Racer.  Next stop, mile post 96. The trail at mile post 96 is exactly at the turn-out at MP 96, not the one a little farther on with the Port-a-Potty that goes to Castle Rock.  The start is a little hard to find, to the left side of the pull-out.  I was hoping this was the beginning of the trail I had found a few years earlier.  Unfortunately, like the one at Castle Rock, this is a climber's trail that dead-ends at a cliff.  I tried to continue on up from there off-trail, but after going up a little ways, it was clear this was not feasible.  I decided to go back down to skirt the rock formation that was blocking the way. I met two young women who were also looking for the Tumwater Botanical Area trail and found the sign directing them to MP 96. I found a way up to the right of the climbing rock and continued beyond up another 1500' vertical elevation before turning around because I was running out of time.  This is a truly spectacular climb not only because there is a continuous view of the canyon itself, but also because of the many interesting rock formations along the way.  The roar of the Wenatchee River drowns out the busy highway below and one always feels as if one is in a wild place.  It is sad there is no trail all the way up out of Tumwater Canyon, because this is the most scenic route up to the highlands in the Leavenworth area, already way over-crowded.  The route I took is only for those comfortable with off-trail travel, but it actually feels safer than some trails.  I refer to those really steep trails with a hardpan topped by a thin layer of sand or gravel.  The ones where, on the downhill, your feet are constantly threatening to slip out from underneath and send you flying down on your butt.  The soil on the mountain is soft and loose, permitting you to dig in your heels and plunge step down the steep slope.  The slope is open with few downed trees.  There is one caveat.  The area within three hundred vertical feet of the road is well-guarded by cliffs, so it is important to come down the same way you go up in order to avoid getting cliffed-out.  I found a new species of broomrape on the slope, which parasitizes buckwheats, but not my target species.  There are lots of buckwheat and some lupines in bloom up there, but many species are finishing up for the season.  If you get up high enough, there is Tweedy's lewisia. I thought I'd try one more place on Tumwater Mountain before giving up for this year.  This time I tried FR 7701 on the back side of Tumwater Mountain.  Being a Sunday, there was a fair amount of road traffic up the mountain, mainly of people with bicycles, but, mercifully, no motorbikes.  This is definitely an easier way up the mountain, but shaded with few views until you get near the top.  The road branches several times, take two lefts to get to the summit.  Many flowers are at the end of their flowering season, but there is some Tweedy's lewisia and lots of lupine still in bloom.  I found many spotted coralroot orchids along the road and one striped coralroot. I also found one of my target species, two phantom orchids, on a spur off the main route.  Unfortunately, they were still immature and not blooming yet.  There is a rough trail along the ridge of Tumwater which I did not have time to explore.  The view at the top is fantastic. I still want to find those other plants, so I guess next year I've got another off-trail route to do on another part of the mountain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The town became a victim of both technological progress and the needs of a much larger municipality. By 1908 the town was home to around 250 residents. In addition to the residents’ homes the town had a hotel, roundhouse, post office, general store, and a school. One resident fought hard for Lester to be recognized by Washington's historic register. Gertrude Murphy was one of the 26 people left living in the town by 1980. She had been a schoolteacher in Lester, but as the town dwindled, she became a champion for the town as well as a board member for the school. The school was closed in 1985, when the state legislature determined that the town was too small to operate a school, and Murphy worked full time to save Lester. In 1993, her home burned down, and she moved a mile and a half out of town into a cabin that she referred to as ""the suburb of Lester."" Murphy died in 2002, the last resident of Lester. By the 1940’s the rail line serviced by Lester was switching from steam to diesel locomotives. The new engines had no need to stop in Lester for fuel or supplies, which meant the town had lost a major source of income. The town began to decline. In the 1960’s the City of Tacoma sought to shut down Lester to protect the drinking water quality of the Green River Watershed, and by 1969 the city had purchased the land on which the town sat. The final nail in Lester’s coffin came in 1984 when the BNSF Railroad stopped using the rail line that ran through the town altogether. The line was reopened again in 1996, but by then the town was no more. Hike Description Written by Exploring History in Your Hiking Boots , WTA Community",,,,,,,,"All the town buildings are gone. Found some foundations, old appliances, sinks, bathtubs, lots of likely fuel oil barrels, etc. Game warden told us a few years ago the last buildings were demolished due to bad condition and a safety hazard.

Five of the waterfalls are more than 100 feet tall and one can walk behind four of the falls.

Snow started in earnest after passing the trestle but I was able to make it to the junction with FR 6830 (Tonga Ridge) before turning around and parking about .2 miles before.  Ruts were mostly gravel with the berms around 6-7 inches.  4-wheel drive helped deal with the snow but I knew it would be a sloppy mess on my out so I erred on the side of caution. Plus, I never did like the sound of scraping the undercarriage. Since I have a Tonga Ridge Snowshoe on my bucket list, I hiked back up the road and turned up on FR 6830.  From here I probably could have made it a little further in the car but by the first switchback the ruts in the snow would have been more than my Element could have managed. The first mile the ruts were exposed gravel but by that first switchback the ruts were mostly snow and continued to get deeper the further I went.  There were so many waterfalls! It wasn't long until there were some branches/trees across the road with the first significant one being about 2 miles up.  The tracks continued so I am guessing only those with serious off-road clearance are making it past this point unless like me they are on foot.  There was a good size tree down at 3.3 miles that I can't imagine anyone in a vehicle going over but who knows because the tracks continued.  Maybe the tree came down after? I made it about 4.4 miles up Tonga Ridge Road before opting for lunch and soaking up the views at a spot where the trees were sparse enough to see the surrounding peaks. Malachite, Bald Eagle and Sobieski were the most prominent along my trek.  The tracks continued past here, maybe they go at least to the junction with Mount Sawyer Road? I had my snowshoes but didn't need them because of the compact snow of tire marks.  I did put them on for a while on the way down since I had them but eventually the ruts were too annoying so I took them back off.  If I wanted to do a lot more ""breaking trail"" there was plenty of snow on the sides of the road if so inclined. All-in-all I did about 9 miles car-to-car and could not have asked for a better day.  I only saw one other group, 4 people in a jeep who turned around and parked where the first set of trees were down.  And of course, I passed some monster trucks headed up as I was driving down. Looking towards the trailheads to East/West Fork, the road conditions looked to be about the same.  Higher clearance and 4-wheel drive a must.

We thought we'd get better weather but it was cloudy all day and therefore not great views. Precipitation held off and no wind, so it was comfortable. Most people seem to climb this one when there is more snow, but today there was only 1"" above 4k' and 4"" at the summit around 5.3k'. So we hit a lot of vegetation and bushwhacking. Saw plenty of animal tracks in the snow, including fresh bear tracks, which looked to have been made between the time we ascended and descended! Parked just before the gate a short ways up Salmon Creek Rd which is off the Index-Galena Rd. No facilities. Started the hike behind the gate on the road around 7:15 am. We wanted to leave plenty of daylight for the descent. This old road goes up pretty high and progressively gets worse and more overgrown the higher you go. There are some very long switchbacks lower down which will compel you to go cross country to cut them. The first 1.5 miles we stuck to the road and made one switchback. Per previous GPX tracks, at this point we left the road and started uphill. Some sections are open forest that aren't too bad, besides lots of blowdowns. Other sections have a lot of alder and trees, in addition to many blowdowns, and require some steep and annoying bushwhacking. We went through many shorter and longer sections, maybe 8 of them, and also occasionally made use of the old road. Eventually the road runs out and we started the long hike up on various ridges, which mostly was open terrain and not too much bushwhacking. There seemed to be faint trails in places, possibly game trails, that were able to use. The final section is mostly boulder field. With more snow, it would be a pretty straight forward snowfield ascent. However, we only had 2-4"" of snow, so have to travel carefully over the boulders. Luckily it wasn't enough to hide many posthole opportunities, but it was enough to take a good grip of the microspikes. The clouds moved in as we summitted, so we didn't have any views of surrounding larger peaks, just some of the closer ones. Still, it was a satisfying ascent. After a break, we headed back down, not looking forward to the bushwhacking. Things mostly went quickly though, with a few breaks for snacks, and we made it down just after 3:30, an hour to spare for sunset. Who misses the summer? Stats: 9.7 miles, 4,250' gain, 8:17 total time, 1:40 stopped time Gear: Poles, waterproof boots (TX4s), microspikes, gaiters, gore-tex layers and gloves, glasses for all the times I got whacked in the face by vegetation.

Earlier in the week I was deliberating on a snowshoe destination when a trip report popped up on NWHikers describing an ascent of Mineral Butte. The pictures looked amazing, and the hike's been on my radar for some time, so, decision made. Arrived around 9 with one other car in the parking area. Started around 0915 and followed the road pretty much the entire way, save for one shortcut which honestly I don't think was worth the trouble. Put on microspikes around 3200' and kept going. Near the end of the road before turning into the forest, I caught up with the owners of the other car, a couple of fun-loving dudes named Hans and Tristan. Turns out they were also inspired by the same NWHikers report! Good times. We headed out together and put on snowshoes at the clearing around 4000'. I had to take some extra time for a food-bio break while they pushed on ahead and upward. The final approach was fairly difficult; the afternoon sun had started softening the wide exposed snowfield slope, which turned my snowshoes into more of a liability than an asset. Regardless, I persevered and made it to the top, where the fellows were still enjoying themselves. Mineral Butte provides a unique vantage in all directions; you can see almost the entire span of the central Cascades, up-close views of Columbia Peak, Mt Pugh, Three Fingers and even far into the Olympics. Worth it! Hung out chatting with the guys for awhile, and then made myself a coffee and freeze dried meal while they headed out. Refilled my water bottle with some melted snow, took in a few more moments of the amazing views, and packed up. On the way back down I changed into the microspikes and did a sort of half-glissade half-sidestep down the snowfield, which had turned even sloppier, to the treeline. From there I followed various tracks back to the road/trail. Uneventful descent and was able to make it down to the last mile or so before finally turning on my headlamp. Got to the car around 5:30 and away I went. Overall I had a perfectly good time taking the road; the slide alder does get more prevalent further up but it's never more than a minor nuisance in a few spots. To me the extra mileage was worth the tradeoff of not schwacking up the forest that most people seem to do, but, as always, HYOH!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After leaving the old road section of the trail we were going through a nice moss-covered forest area. After going by the huge Western Red Cedar snag the trail heads downhill where it crosses several small creeks on bridges. At one of the bridges, we saw some repair work had been done because of a conifer tree that had blown over onto the bridge that is now cut out. This is also where the side trail takes off going north over the rock wall is located that climbers use. Further down the trail we came across a few fallen trees on the trail that we climbed over. We went as far as the big roaring creek with no name where we took a snack break and some photos. This creek runs all year, and you need to boulder hoop to get across it. On the way back on the trail, we met a woman and her two dogs, plus two other guys out on this nice sunny day.

Improved by WTA volunteers thanks to a puncheon about halfway through, this wide trail offers a short but sweet ramble. It's just the thing to tag onto the end of a long hike as a cool down, to introduce kids to hiking or to take a slow saunter for recovery from injury. Spot Stegosaurus Butte through the trees, enjoy the lush moss, sit by the Taylor River while viewing Garfield Mountain, and get a quick dose of nature on this short ramble. Hike Description Written by Multiple authors contributed to this report, WTA Community",,,,,,,"47.5485 , -121.5369 Map & Directions","I haven't hiked much recently so picked this one for our last ""spring day"", as it has just enough elevation to make you feel you accomplished something!  We parked at the large middle fork parking lot and walked the connector over to the start of the ledge trail.  Always recommend this as the potholes on the far side of the Taylor river bridge at the ledge parking area are now car eating size.  Temperatures were all over the map, 50s in North Bend on the way in, mid 30s at the parking lot - 40s when we returned.  As we hiked up the ledge trail things warmed up nicely, and with the sun out the ledge is a nice place to catch a few rays.  The view was great and you can see all the way back down the valley to Rattlesnake Ledge.  The trail is dry and you don't need winter boots.  We stepped over a number of small trees on the way to and from the ledge trail, but apart from that everything is in great shape. We didn't linger at the ledge but stopped on the way down at the Taylor Rover picnic area (right  by the start of the ledge trail), to snack on coffee and Met Market cookies in the sun.  Be careful here as the river has seriously undercut the bank and some of the tables are no longer on solid ground.  After our treats we wandered back via the camp ground nature trail and CCC trail.  Find the turn for that on your right immediately after you recross the bridge. I love that section of the CCC trail, the moss lined path is sublime. Total mileage was 4.5.  Outhouses for both middle fork and ledges were decent, the ledge outhouse was newly serviced and stocked.  Was saddened to see road side garbage in some of the pull outs on the road in, but on the way out a forest service vehicle had pulled in to take care of that. CAUTION - there was a tree down blocking the eastward drive lane before you reach the locals housing.  The remainder of the road in was clear but there are two sections that are down to single lanes and have red barriers.  Hopefully we are not going to lose the road, that would be a sad day as the valley is such a gem of a place to both visit and hike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Facilities include a picnic area, children's play area, three groomed baseball fields, restroom facilities, 15 basic camp sites and about 3 miles of forested trails. The park also makes a convenient access point to the southern end of the Rhododendron Trail, a separate mixed-use trail that parallels Highway 20 north through Coupeville and beyond. One quick warning - the park is close to the Naval Air Station Whidbey secondary OLF field which when in use can be thunderously noisy so having a back up walk in mind if the jets are flying is a good idea. The trail system consists of a central paved north/south trail, ""Rhodie Road"", and a series of dirt trails that make a rough exterior loop which can sometimes be a bit hard to follow as signage is limited. Forest cover is typical second generation, largely evergreen trees. The main draw, as the park name suggests, is the brilliant show of blooming native rhododendrons in late spring. The Washington State flower is the Pacific Rhododendron and the park delivers with thousands of individual plants with hundreds of thousands of blooms in this relatively small area. Hike Description Written by Erik Morgenstern , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"Walked the Rhododendron Park trails Wednesday from the main southern lot off Patmore Rd.  Parking is free and plentiful.  There are also a few spots on the north end off the park next to the campground off Hwy 20.  Full restrooms were open and in good condition next to the sports fields plus there is one other sanican here plus another up by the campground.  The trails are in good condition with just a couple muddy/sloppy spots but nothing problematic.  Do consider taking a cell phone pic of the trail map heading out as trail signage is present along the center trail but not out along some of the smaller dirt singletrack and can be a little confusing.  The only other quick FYI is that this property is right next to the Navy OLF backup field where they will sometimes do touch and goes in their EA-18G Growler jets which while neat to watch are very, very loud and having a back up walk in mind if they are flying is a prudent idea.  The draw this time of year is the thousands of blooming wild rhododendron bushes.  It really is pretty amazing looking out into the fairly dense forest and it’s completely carpeted with blooming light pink rhodies.  They are slightly floral smelling as well unlike most of the human bred variants.  Lots of salal bushes blooming right now too with their delicate white to pale pink flowers.  Wildlife included a bunch of squirrels and chipmunks, some small forest birds, a pair of bald eagles way overhead and the highlight was pair of very vocal and loud raven calling with all sorts of noises, normal >grok, grok< and clicks and screams and weird >tick, bong< noises that sound vaguely like somebody playing pickleball or knocking wood together - really cool.  The northern end of the park also connects directly with the Rhododen Trail which is a paved, mixed use trail that runs all the way back into Coupeville proper if you’d like some extra distance.  The rhodies are probably a week or so from max bloom so now is a good time to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We pulled out our guidebook for this area (Day Hiking the San Juans, Craig Romano) and found one we could get a nice walk right from the ferry dock, saving ourselves the $$$ ferry. I'm going to make this a bit long, so you can benefit from what we learned.  We picked Indian Cove, a road walk to the Shaw County Park and a trail back thru the Graham Preserve, about 5.5 miles RT. This made a great outing, even tho the skies were overcast and the water grey. First, we had a small window of time to go there and back again, in the words of a famous Hobbit. The ferry left Anacortes at 730, so it was an early morning, bringing our breakfast on the ferry, concessions are closed. The ferry was late, due to the fog, so we didn't get going until after 8, and not starting our walk until 930. We wanted to catch the 1240, the next one would have stranded us there until 430. Off the ferry, walk along Blind Bay road, a quiet country road with views of the water and some fun road decorations the local residents have made. When you get to the Shaw Community Center, turn left onto Reef Net Bay Road (originally Squaw Bay Rd), and a sign for the County Park. Since the guidebook, the road has been renamed for obvious reasons. Keep on this road and you will come to Shaw County Park. The park has a few camp spots (reserve) and beach access. There is private beach here too, signed. Once we checked out the beach, we got back on the road and kept going around the corner until we found a sign on the right side with a hiker on it signed for the Preserve. We followed this thru the forest until it comes out at the Community Center on Blind Bay road just down from the corner we turned on. We were now headed back well within our strict turnaround time. We walked a little more slowly on the way back knowing were good on time. When we got back, the ferry was running over an hour late, so we checked out the store, got some coffee and a cookie, and ate our lunch at a picnic table by the ferry dock. If your ferry is ON TIME, you could do a bit more by going to the Ceder Rock Preserve, another mile down the road on the Hoffman Cove Road. You could also take the trail thru the preserve both ways and skip the road walk. Backpacking down to the park and staying overnight would be another choice, I bet the sunsets are fantastic! The most important thing to remember when doing these island walks is, check the ferry schedule, be flexible, and have a firm turnaround time to make it back. Of importance, there are restrooms at the ferry dock and restrooms at the park. The store has very limited supplies, take what you need, but splurge on a treat.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Shaw Island WTA worked here in 2013!,,,,,,,,"Places like Shaw Island are a bit of a time capsule just waiting to be explored.

If you study your map closely a very sweet road, Rue Gilson that can be used to make a loop. These roads have little traffic, good views, and cute displays of local art. The dockside pub, if open is a gem and the store has great treats. A visit here would be great any time of year. As a bonus we visited nearby Blind Island. There is boat in only campground here (though we moored in the harbor). A user made trail runs around the island visiting intertidal zones, dry grassy hillsides, and steep drop-offs.

While I imagine they were not nearly at full strength when I had the opportunity to visit them, it still was a great experience to have, and a unique area to explore around and under via the trail. This visit was a part of a longer day hike further up the Goat Creek, but I spent much of that time early on viewing these falls. One part that I found interesting was the inverse fern growth out of the ceilings of the cavern beneath. I enjoyed a light spraying at multiple points on the trail approaching and while under in the cavernous area. This section did have a few points with loose and wet rock, and there are some steep drop offs, so be mindful of your steps while visiting.

The north side of St. Helens was the least affected by the 1980 blast, and the forest that the Goat Creek Trail winds through is home to huge, old trees that survived the eruption that obliterated the forests on the other side of the mountain. The trail leaves a small parking area large enough for five cars and traverses the hillside through quiet forest of red cedar and hemlock. Mossy rocks, and plenty of trailside distractions like chipmunks and slugs will keep kids entertained. Continue gently climbing to Cathedral Falls, the highlight of the hike. The trail provides an intimate, 360-degree view of the falls, leading hikers towards the base of an enormous waterfall, and then winding behind it. Hike under a cave and enjoy the spray from the falls, but be careful — the trail drops steeply away off to your left here and a wrong step can mean a far fall.

The hike begins 2 miles down Crystal Mountain Boulevard and down a short spur road. After crossing the bridge over Silver Creek, turn right on the first road you come to and park at the dead end – you will see the trail. This trail doesn’t see too much traffic until the summit, but beware of occasional mountain bikers and horseback riders. As you gain elevation the shaded young forest transitions from hemlock to fir. You will skirt impressive cliffs before the trail opens to meadows where you can see across Crystal Mountain Boulevard to Norse Peak and Castle Mountain. This section is great in the fall when the scrub oak turns to bright red! Once to the ridge you will turn left, north, and follow the ridgeline. Look down to see ski runs off to your left and more wonderful vistas to your right. The final slog takes you past Northway chair and Green Valley via a gravel road up to the summit house and gondola. Here is where you wonder how a flat “cat track” can be such a challenging hike. If you’re doing an out-and-back, this is the turnaround point.

BERRY REPORT:  In the fir canopy the deciduous dark purple/black huckleberries of good size are so plentiful, they brush against you for about 1.5 miles along the trail.  No need to leave the trail; they're right there, cool and ranging from somewhat tart to sweet.  After the first real clearing at the ridge you'll find a meadow of 8"" tall sturdy shrubs with the teeny, tiny fuchsia/purple huckleberries, each one a shocking drop of pure sugar!  But, the real star of the show is back on an ancient avalanche chute that you switchback over about three times that has been taken over by thimbleberries by the millions.  My hiking buddy, an original Southern boy, was discovering this joy for the first time.  It was fun to watch him unable to get enough into his mouth.  The bliss of people discovering nature that they never previously comprehended!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"46.9615 , -121.4830 Map & Directions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanted to check out conditions on a couple trails, and started with Sullivan Lakeshore since that was closest to where I camped Saturday night. I started at the south end and mostly wanted to check out the early miles due to reports of some challenging trail conditions. Noisy Creek Campground isn't open for the season yet, so I parked near the gate and walked in. I was surprised by how low the water is currently, although I'm sure that will be changing soon as the snow starts to melt in the high country. I found the trail to be somewhat brushy and narrow in places, although all-in-all pretty good for early season. But I turned around just after the mile mark, so no reports on what conditions might be like beyond that point. When I stopped to re-tie my shoelaces near the end of the hike, I discovered I had several hitchhikers: ticks! It was funny because I had treated my hiking pants & shirt with permethrin ahead of the hike, but I forgot to spray my hiking shoes. The ticks were mostly trying to hide in my shoelaces. I think I found a total of six or seven, including a few later in the day, although I suspect I picked them all up on the Lakeshore Trail. It's kind of a known hotspot for them. After leaving Sullivan Lake I headed for Halliday, since I'm leading a trailwork crew up there next month. I discovered that there is still quite a bit of snow on this trail: patchy for the first mile, and then completely snow-covered beyond Halliday Fen (at which point I turned around). I'm sure it will melt out significantly in the next month and will be ready for the trailwork crew, and I found there are even a few warm-up trees down for us in the first mile of trail. At that point it was lunchtime, and I couldn't think of a better spot to enjoy my packed sandwich than the Riverside Canyon Overlook! It's just a short drive from the Halliday trailhead. There was a bit of snow over the roadway in shady areas: probably only a problem for very low clearance vehicles. The trail itself is snow free, and the viewpoint is fantastic. After that it was time to start making my way home, but I couldn't pass by Sweet Creek Falls without making the stop! The waterfall is roaring right now and will only get better with additional snowmelt.

I did this via Mirror/Cottonwood lake and parked at the mirror lake trailhead. There was only one other car parked at the Th when I arrived at 7:30. There is parking, but it's all spread along the road. The parking is 0.2 miles from the actual trailhead, the final stretch of road has deteriorated to the point no cars are getting up that.  There are no facilities at this TH.  Road The road to get to the TH is in great shape, quite a bit on gravel but no potholes and no big rocks. I think just about any car should be able to do this easily. Maybe one or two rocky bits where you might want to take more care and that's it. I think the bigger challenge would be staying on the right road as it's a bit of a maze back there with FS roads.  Trail to Mirror Lake This is a really easy and beautiful trail. I see why it's popular with families. Nicely graded, nothing challenging and you get to the lakes very quickly. One person was camping at Cottonwood lake.  Boot-path to East summit The boot path up to Tinkham kicks this up quite a bit from the ease of the Mirror lake trail. Finding the entry to the boot-path might be tricky if you don't have nav simply because there are a lot of social trails around the lake.  The steep grade in the forest is honestly the worst part, about 50 feet straight up with some blow-downs to navigate around. Not too bad but my least favorite part.  After you break the trees on the final few hundred feet the views really open up. This is also the final steep section with more rocks this time. Overall as a boot-path this isn't bad, easy to follow and even though it's steep it's pretty short so it's over before you know it.  The summit itself has such a cool view for an easy climb like this. The lakes below make for a unique vantage. There is also a summit box located on the east summit. Lots of room on the summit ridge, but be careful with pets as the cliffs on the north side are sheer, there is the potential for a fatal fall if you were to stumble too close to the edge.   Boot-path to West Summit I came planning to make sure I got all of Tinkham, so I took the boot-path over to the west summit as well. This was also a very clear trail, and not as bad in terms of eg gained and lost as I had been expecting. Easy walk along the ridge, which was very scenic and you're on the other summit! I do think it's worth doing both, as there are some small lakes and tarns you cannot see from the east summit that you get from the west, also I imagine this summit gets fewer visitors.  The Return On my return I encountered a few people climbing up to Tinkham (5 total). Things were a little busier down by the lake, one group of day hikers and another set of backpackers. I only passed 2 other people on the PCT section on my way out until I got to the parking lot.  There were roughly 10 cars parked for the Mirror lake TH when I returned at noon. Easy to get out, everyone was parked out of the way so there were no problems.  Really fun climb, gorgeous views! Finally got the summit of the mountain I am always seeing from Silver peak.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Tinkham Peak,,,,,,,,"I followed @youcandoit's excellent and informative trip report from yesterday. I had a bit more time, so I went up and over Tinkham(s) clockwise starting from Mirror Lake. It started to rain on my way down, but by the time I got back to the junction just above Mirror Lake, the rain had stopped - so I created a figure 8 by passing Mirror Lake again and heading downhill to visit Twilight. The route up and over Tinkham was wet, but there were only a few brief stretches of snow - and they were not on the steep portions of the hike. I definitely recommend completing this route counterclockwise so you reach the last stream crossing pictured in @youcandoit's trip report at the end of your day. This was the only crossing all day where it felt virtually impossible to keep my feet dry - but it helped to know I was almost back at the car. I found a few tent stakes along the shores of Mirror Lake, and a small garden shovel high up on Tinkham. Let me know if these might be yours. I also spotted several doggie bags but did not pack those out this time because my trash bag was already full of metal objects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some lose gravel and larger lose stones on the trail at some parts so be careful with footing. In short, take the time to think about where you step on parts of the trail with loose small rocks as you could easily twist an ankle. But don't let that stop you! The hike was amazing and well worth it.",,,,708 feet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Oneonta Trail to Triple Falls This long, steep trail is one of the most challenging routes that leads to Larch Mountain, 7.7 miles away. Luckily, Triple Falls, just 1.7 miles into the trail, is one of the biggest draws of this hike, and a perfectly reasonable destination for most. And for those who want to go a little further on, there's a bridge at 3.06 miles with a shaded boulder field that would offer a 6.12 mile trip with about 1500 feet of elevation gain. To reach Triple Falls, from the trailhead, switchback up the Horsetail Falls trail for 0.2 miles to a T intersection. Turn right, and follow Horsetail Falls west. For a mile, you'll traverse just above the Columbia River Historic Highway, passing Ponytail Falls and Middle Oneonta Falls before connecting with the Oneonta Trail. At the intersection with the Oneonta trail, head uphill (left). Now you're on a moderately-steep and relatively exposed, rocky trail. Keep kids close and dogs leashed here; the trail has steep dropoffs through this section. Its about another mile to Triple Falls, which you will see well before you arrive to where the trail crosses the river. Before you arrive at the crossing for Triple Falls, there's a nice viewpoint of the waterfall, but be careful with your footing in this area. If you want to continue past Triple Falls, continue over the river and head upstream again. The trail here becomes a little brushier and stays closer to the river for a little more than a mile to a river crossing with a bridge and a nice shaded boulder field, great for snacks. Continue past the bridge and in just about 0.2 miles arrive at a camping area and intersection with the Horsetail Creek trail. Past this intersection, its 2.2 fairly steep miles to a junction with the Franklin Ridge trail . From here, you can continue along the Franklin Ridge trail to loop up with the Larch Mountain Trail, or you can continue on the Oneonta Trail for 2.3 miles to the summit of Larch Mountain.

We hiked a clockwise loop from Wahtum Lake to Chinidere Mountain, then on to Tomlike Mountain, returning via the Anthill trail.  There was some fall color up on the ridge to, and past, Tomlike Mountain, before that the foliage is mainly green.  The better fall color was as we were returning on the Anthill trail -vine maple near rock outcrops overlooking Wahtum Lake and some overgrown huckleberry bushes. The trail to Chinidere is in good shape.  The trail heading toward Tomlike included 9 downed trees in short succession, all easy to cross.  The trail to Tomlike includes varied terrain including forest, open ridges, scrub pine, a short boulder field before the ridge climb up to  Tomlike Mountain's summit. From the summit the ridge continues northwest. There were around 8 downed trees on the Anthill trail (smaller branch-sized so not really worth mentioning).

You'll quickly turn to the right and start the descent. The trail follows a small creek down the draw and is mostly wooden box steps with gravel. Enjoy the native coltsfoot and cow parsnip along the trail amidst more common rainforest flora. The trail ends at a short bridge with driftwood flourishes that crosses to an uneven rock outcropping. From the rock, it's about a 4-foot drop to the sand. At this time, there's a rope tied to the bridge to help you climb up and down. There's no other structured or safe method to reach the beach. Wind, water and erosion can quickly change beach landscapes, but this rocky entrance provides a more sustainable access point. Note that the only places to camp on the southern coast of the Olympic National Park are at the Kalaloch campground (3 miles from Beach 4) and the South Beach campground (6.5 miles from Beach 4). If you plan to adventure further along the beach, always make sure to check the tide times. On the return ascent up the stairs, if you need to stop to catch your breath, there's a rustic wooden bench before the final turn.

Hike Description Written by Aaron Czechowski , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,," Trip report for Monday, July 7, 2025 to Ruby Beach, and Beach 1, 2, 3, & 4. Made a day doing five mini-hikes along the Kalaloch Beach area and Forks on a foggy Monday. Started north at Ruby Beach about 1:45pm in the afternoon. It was crazy crowded at Ruby Beach for a Monday (granted, however, it’s summer in July). Parking lot full and lines at the restrooms. The short trail to the beach is in good shape. The beach is still beautiful with all the shifting logs and rocks from the last winter storms, but got out of there quick with all the crowds and found peace and quiet at all the other nearby beaches and trails. Keep in mind, all of the trails to these beaches are short – like not even a quarter mile to get to the beach. Started north working south at Beach 4. It has a large parking lot and pit toilets available - take advantage of this because neither are at any of the other beaches listed below. Beach 4 has stairs leading to the beach and the bridge. A rope is attached to the bridge to help you down, but really it’s not necessary if you’re conditioned, and it’s a short distance down the rocks to the sand. The beach is lovely here - walked north to the point for tide, pulling, and rock hopping. Then drove a short distance to Beach 3, this trail switchbacks to a quick descent to the beach. There are a couple of faded but informative signs describing the area. Once down at the beach, there are some very cool rock formations that I was able to walk on and around during the low tide. Continuing on down to Beach 2, look for the trail sign right before the guard rail. A quick few steps to the beach and loads of rocks (like Ruby Beach) greet you - and amazing logs and huge tree stumps along the beach as well. Finally, Beach 1 also has easy access and immediately starts in a short burl tree forest loop. Amazingly strange and beautiful trees in my opinion. A trail then takes you down the stairs and across the bridge to the beach. You have to do some climbing over our logs, (so be careful because they can get loose) to reach the beach. Very stunning area with wind trees along the ridge here. Side note - Beaches 1 - 3 really don’t have parking. They are just turnouts for no more than four or five cars right on Highway 101 so be careful. I lucked out late in the afternoon on a Monday & I was able to get access every time I stopped, but I can’t imagine on the weekends. If you can get parking, it’s worth a quick trek to get to these beaches. They are all beautiful.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hike Description Written by Multiple authors contributed to this report, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"Since the Forest Service recently opened Catherine Creek to recreation again after the Burdoin Fire in July 2025, we hiked the Catherine Creek Arch Loop to check out the fire impacts. As soon as I got out the car, I could smell the smoky scent of burned ground and trees despite four months having passed since the fire. Some areas of ground still were black and bare where the fire had burnt most intensely. Much of the burned area has greened up with introduced non-native grasses. We noticed burned Oregon white-oaks resprouting from their roots. Some shrub species, like ocean spray, also were sprouting new growth from their roots. The trailhead kiosk survived the fire. We passed it as we set off on our hike. We hiked the loop clockwise, hiking first on the Atwood Road to the spur where the BPA powerline maintenance road crosses Catherine Creek. An oak tree has fallen across the ""trail gnome""-built footbridge, but we didn't need it since Catherine Creek was dry and we could walk across at the vehicle ford. We approached the Catherine Creek Arch, where a new buck-and-rail fence replaced the fence that burned and a new interpretive sign explains the arch is sacred to the Yakama Nation and is closed to the public. The old corral and remnants of ranch structures burned in the fire and nothing is left. We birded and botanized as we hiked, so our pace was slow. We saw about a half dozen acorn woodpeckers and a large convention of Stellar's jays convening in a tree next to Catherine Creek. Many juncos, kinglets, chickadees and brown creepers flitted among the oak trees. A prairie falcon flew low overhead while we were eating lunch. We looked for signs of returning wildflowers; we saw grass widow stems only about an inch out of the ground, small lupine starts, and bitterroot, micranthes species, and western buttercup leaves. Along the eastern part of the loop trail, several pine trees killed by the fire have fallen across the trail. We were able to go around them. The WTA-built log bridge across Catherine Creek survived the fire, with only a scorch mark on the underside of the log to show that the Burdoin Fire had passed through here. We completed the loop and returned to our cars. NOTE: a portapotty is available at the trailhead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"45.7105 , -121.3621 Map & Directions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recorded just over a mile of trail on the loop we took. Then we drove down and checked out the new Russian Butte View access point. There’s a short trail to the river, with wooden logs to sit on and reflect while you admire the view. Russian Butte was hiding in the clouds, but it was still a nice spot. We ended up at the big Middle Fork trailhead, where we checked out the new paths and picnic tables. There are some huge trees back there!

Once on top of the ridge near point 2990 I noticed an elk herd relaxing in the saddle between me and point 3016. I decided not to continue as they were safe and sound from hunters below buzzing around on their quads. I instead watched them from the distance while having lunch before the steep descent. No trails in this area other than old roads in Green Gulch and a short section of single track in Joseph Creek Canyon which disappears within a mile or so in blackberry brambles.

It shares a trailhead access point with the more popular Stevens Lake , and is only a short distance from an access point for the Idaho Centennial Trail. The route to Lone Lake starts on an old roadbed converted to trail, where the impacts of both timber and mining industry are still highly visible on the surrounding landscape. The trail is short and ascends quickly, and soon enters a recovering forest. This trail is ideal for summer dayhikes and fall color hikes. Snow tends to linger here, although the trail is usually accessible by early to mid-June. The hillsides around Lone Lake are covered in huckleberry bushes, perfect for late summer treats and spectacular fall colors. The trail climbs over 1600 feet in just 2 miles and deposits hikers at the outlet stream of Lone Lake with a dramatic backdrop of Stevens Peak towering overhead. Adventurous hikers can find the climbers' trail leading up the more moderate western slope above Lone Lake and gradually ascending to the ridge where it is possible to hike to Stevens Peak's summit, or even extend the hike down to neighboring Stevens Lakes. Hike Description Written by Holly Weiler, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"Today I decided to do the full loop for the Stevens Lake trail head. This was something I'd been encouraged to do but couldn't find a ton of info online about. Here's how it worked: I started up to Lower Stevens, which was gorgeous and warm. There was one tent set up, not sure if it was occupied when I hiked past it. Proceeded to hike the trail over to Upper Stevens. Note that this trail is in pretty rough shape and overgrown in many places; I definitely hiked off-trail for several annoying minutes of it. Markers could be helpful if not just better maintenance. Upper Stevens didn't have any people at it, and it was a much harder lake to get access to. I did see a single, adult mule deer and she was utterly gorgeous. We observed each other for a good minute before I marched on. The little side trails that break off at the lake and go up the valley wall--these are what I took, since there wasn't anything in any of trail apps showing a designated route up to the peak. I basically said ""this isn't vert, so I can hike up it."" I followed what turned out to be game trails above the treeline, and continued up and up and up and made it to the ridge. The far rock formation on the right of the ridge was my first ""sit"" or major break of the day, but there were so many of those fly/gnat things that I couldn't get a proper rest in, just for some water. I was a bit worried about how steep it was going up and how awful it would be if I did have to go back down. No spoilers. After gauging the ridge-line and thinking about how much problem-solving the light scrambling would yield, I suddenly saw it gleaming in the light: an old climber's trail! This trail followed the ridge 100% of the way to the summit, and it made me wonder if there was indeed a proper route up to the top of the ridge from Upper Stevens after all! After getting to the summit of Stevens, which was much faster than I intended (though I was very exhausted), I looked at the immensity of the valley on the Lone Lake side. I was a bit terrified as a solo hiker. I was told I would probably have to bushwhack to Lone Lake, and looking down from above was much different than gauging vert from below. But I did notice the ridge trail opened up a bit on the other side of Stevens and there was faint resemblances of game trail that I could just barely make out. I knew that if I had to turn around and head back the way I came, there was plenty of time for that, but I took the risk and challenged myself to push forward. The trail turned into an OHV trail of all things, and I followed that easily and quickly to what looked like the best descent point that didn't just drop off into oblivion. Taking one step at a time, I was able to navigate all the way down to the valley floor. Bonus was the sheer number of huckleberry bushes I walked through, which kept me hydrated and filled with positive energy. Getting to the valley was much easier than I thought, but then I had to make my way to Lone Lake! I knew where it was from the source lake but couldn't actually see it, so I had to go through some pretty unnervingly dense bushes. I screamed ""Hey Bear"" a gazillion times since this was perfect bear habitat, but didn't see any evidence of bears the entire trip. I slowly made my way down the source water to the source lake via game trail and amazingly found someone had cut open a trail that I could walk out, passing the source lake towards Lone Lake. I lost the trail a couple times but managed to find the trail at Lone Lake easily enough. My first sighting of real people was there, a couple enjoying the warm water and swimming. A brief hello and I didn't want to intrude so I decided to not jump in the water (I'll be back for that, I hope, on another trip!). I found myself easily walking the main trail out from Lone Lake, which took about an hour. The lot started with a few cars including mine, and ended with closer to ten! There were even folks just starting their treks when I arrived, much to my surprise (it got hot out!). Overall this was a fantastic adventure in the true sense of the word. I challenged myself, I found myself nervous and mildly afraid, and I figured out ways to overcome and persist, and I succeeded at the end of the day. One thing that was very helpful with my confidence is the fact that the beginning of the trail up to Stevens / Lone Lake has great cell service, and Stevens Peak and the full ridge also has full 5G, so I was able to share my location with my partner for most of the ""sketchy part.""

I had been planning to attempt Kyes Peak for a while, and found a good day to get it done. Rode my motorcycle to the trailhead for extra adventure. The Blanca Lake trailhead took a bit of work to find via Beckler Road just past Skykomish. There were a dozen or so cars in the parking lot just after 7 AM. Climbing the Blanca Lake Trail from the trailhead to Virgin Lake is easy to follow, just a long walk uphill. Once off-trail, climbing from Virgin Lake to the ridgeline is fairly steep and slick in places. There is a decent climber's trail for the majority of the walk, and orange and pink surveyor's tape occasionally marks the route, but it's kind of sporadic. Staying on the east side of the ridgeline is recommended once above the obvious grassy meadow at ~4870 ft. A burned out area, with many large downed trees, was a little challenging to navigate. Climbing Blanca Lake East was an accident, because I was in my zone following the ridge. The standard climbing route descends left, from the ridge south of this small peak. After finding myself on top of it, I was cliffed out by the ridge, so I inched my way across some very slick mud-and-veg slopes, with mossy rocks for handholds and hundred-foot runouts below. This felt very slow, but I managed to follow the ridge north, to a saddle holding the main climbing trail, in about half an hour. Climbing from this saddle to the Monte Cristo Benchmark was fun. After leaving the forest, I chose my own adventure across talus and scree, aiming for the gap just north of the last gendarme. There are some cairns here and there, but following the path of least resistance worked fine. While I never once had to walk across snow, there was plenty of running snowmelt, which I used to fill a bottle on my descent. Climbing from the benchmark to Kyes summit is a fourth class scramble on slightly crumbly rock. However, the slab is not as steep as it looks from afar. It was too cloudy for great views from the summit, but on a clear day you'd have a phenomenal view of Glacier Peak and surrounding terrain. I down-climbed very slowly, as a slip on a loose pebble would probably result in a long ride. On the return, I entered the forest too low, resulting in extra uphill travel. Then I opted for the ""main"" trail, which bushwhacks through huckleberry and scrubby trees on the slope below Blanca Lake East. I found this route to be almost as yucky as the muddy veggie belays above, so I'm glad I tagged an extra peak on the ascent. The rest of the descent was uneventful, although keeping upright on slick terrain was much harder after all the vert on the way in. I returned to Highway 2 via the paved Index-Galena road, which was a much more pleasant ride than the washboards and potholes I rode in on. For gear, I did not bring an ice axe. I wore gaiters and shell pants (for wet veg), and carried microspikes, which I never used. Above Blanca Lake, thousands of juicy huckleberries were exploding off the vine! I wouldn't come all the way up here just for huckleberries, but snacking on them was delightful. Wading through them... not so much :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hiking Kyes Peak A scramble to a summit off of Highway 2. Route-finding experience and climbing equipment required.

Additional (minor) snow sources further on. Bugs: None observed on route nor summit. Overnight trip. Road to trailhead (and washout section) in good condition. Only 4 cars in the lot. Reached Virgin lake by late evening and setup camp in a small wooded section just off the turnoff for the climber's trail as it starts upward. Only 2 campers spotted throughout and had complete solitude at Blanca lake for sunset. Note: the false summit (pyramid-shaped peak) is what is visible from Blanca, as the true summit block is obscured from view. Left camp by 9am. Conditions cloudy but everything was wet. Gtx rain pants/coat were vital throughout the morning. Trail starts faint (minor bushwhacking) and requires attention to follow. A handful of pink ribbons mark the way. Will eventually break out of the woods into a slightly more refined boot path, maintaining right (east) of the ridge throughout. Then reaching the first (of two) good meadow sections for camping at ~0.3mi in (4860ft). From here the trail is easily followed and will lead to a small rock gully (class 2/3 scramble). Then continuing on while still maintaining right (east) of the ridge . At 5400ft the 2nd open meadow (campsite) appears, offering views of Blanca lake and Columbia peak - albeit at this time things were still socked-in and damp, and I started to have concerns about whether the summit block would be dry enough to climb. The trail eventually reaches a burnt-out section, crossing from east to west over top of the ridge, and then down to a small rock field below (west) of Point 5600. Beyond here the traverse through numerous sections of meadow, tree belays/bushwhacking, and steep side-hilling begins - where the trail becomes difficult to follow and you will veer off. Though once out of each tree section, it was relatively benign to find and regain the path. I slipped and fell multiple times throughout but was too lazy to stop and put on microspikes. They would certainly be worth bringing, even if the ground is dry. Once passing through the final tree and rock section, a short down-scramble will lead into the large boulder field within view of the false summit. Just over the first minor rock crest at 6200ft is the tarn to filter water. Continue left (clockwise) around it and continue making your way upwards, taking the path of least resistance. Aim for the notch between what looks like an elephants foot on the left and the small sub peak north (photo 1). Going right around the foot and onward will lead you to a scramble path back up to gain the ridge of the false summit. From here it's a relatively flat section to traverse (photo 4) to the true summit block (now in sight) - with excellent views of Columbia peak to the west. Fortunately the weather cleared and the rock was dry by time of reaching the summit block. The final section is a class 3/4 scramble with loose, chossy rock covered in scree. The foot steps are small and the rock is brittle, but the ascent was mostly uneventful given enough care and attention (see photo 2 for route). However the down-climb required significantly more caution and careful maneuvering due to the exposure and potential for slippage. Summit offers brilliant views of Columbia Peak and Monte Cristo - and also sightings of Gothic/Del Campo, Vesper/Big Four, and Sloan/Pugh/Whitechuck. Overall a very-rewarding climb. Good route-finding practice, and the bushwhacking was not as difficult nor frustrating as presumed based on previous trip reports. For the most of the route, a visible boot path exists. Microspikes would be useful for the side-hilling and tree sections. I would not want to be caught navigating back through in the dark via headlamp - so plan your time management accordingly. The summit block does require extreme care. The footholds are small and covered in loose scree, while not offering much in terms of hand holds - but did not have any slip or fall moments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spent the night at Shoofly Spring and went up Round Butte in the morning. The destinations are in Oregon, but the trailhead starts just over the border in Washington, so we are logging this one at WTA.org Solitude report: I saw two people at the trailhead, and didn't see anybody else during the hike. Snow report: A couple small patches of snow remain alongside the road, but roads and trails are snow free. Water report: Don't count on any water up on the ridges. The last snow has melted and the springs are dry. You'll have to descend pretty far down into the gullies to find running water. Trail status: Physically it's an easy trail with very little up and down. There were only 4 or 5 downed trees to cross. A couple small stretches had wildflowers overgrowing the trail, so long pants were nice, but not mandatory. But this was a walk, not a bushwack. The trail was mostly easy to follow, but it was faint in places, and it is easy to miss the junction between the Shoofly and Round Butte trails. But the navigation isn't too hard - you are just following ridges. There is no marked path to the top of Round Butte, just scattered game trails. Wildflower report: Flowers were great. Buckwheats, penstemons, ceanothus, alliums, columbines, and much more. Lots of color and variety. Bug report: Minor bugs, but nothing to complain about. Lots of pollinators enjoying the flowers. The ceanothus were swarming with bumblebees. Quite a few butterflies too. Getting there: You can approach from Walla Walla by taking Mill Creek Road to Tiger Creek, and then turning right to climb up FS Road 65. Mill Creek Road is paved, and FS Road 65 is well graded gravel. When you reach FS Road 64 (Kendall Skyline Road), turn left and head about 4 more miles to the trailhead. FS Road 64 immediately narrows to a single lane and gets pretty rutted. From Dayton you can take North Touchet road toward Bluewood Ski Resort, then continue past Bluewood on FS Road 64 for about 9 miles. FS Road starts as well graded gravel and gradually narrows to a rocky single-lane. Both approaches are pretty comparable in length and ruggedness. High clearance and AWD is helpful, and I'd very be cautious on rainy, wet days. Considering that there were still patches of snow in early July, FS Road 64 could be treacherous early or late in the season. Personally, I preferred the vistas on the Dayton route. The Indian Camp trailhead is a small roundabout just a short drive off of FS Road 64. There's a small stream providing water, but no bathrooms. The trailhead signboard has been knocked down. The trailhead is on my older FS maps, but not the current online maps, so I guess it's no longer being maintained. But the trail is still there for now.",,,"46.0020 , -117.9024 Map & Directions","5,720 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Round Butte This is an out and back on Round Butte Trail that can extend as far as you like.It's delightfully moderate, staying flattish almost until its endpoint at the Wenaha River.

I only walked to Round Butte, about 3.5 miles each way, but wished I could have continued when I saw the terrain ahead. Though the trailhead requires some challenging roads to get to, the trail itself is actually in quite good shape. There are a few large blowdowns in the beginning but the rest of the trail, as far as I walked it, is clear and the tread is easy to follow. A short distance from the start of the hike there is a sign on a tree marking the crossing into Oregon and the trail eventually drops down to Wenaha Forks and joins The Wenaha River Trail. I walked the trail to the saddle on south side of Round Butte and ascended mostly open, grassy slopes to the 5904' summit. The ridgeline ahead was beckoning but I had gotten a late start and would have walked out in the dark. Next time I'll bring overnight gear (and water) to camp along the scenic ridge line. A primitive camp area is available at the trailhead with Indian Spring as a water source. The signboard, as noted in the last report, is no longer standing and presently is in use to dam up the spring creating a pool. The last report also nicely describes the driving conditions and options to get here.

The dam that once impounded Sullivan Creek was removed in 2017 and habitat restoration followed. The site now offers accessible hiking trails in the tranquil northeastern corner of Washington State. Mill Pond Flume Trail is a 0.6 mile interpretive loop that showcases several historic structures, while the 0.9-mile Floodplain Loop takes you through reborn meadows and young groves of willow and aspen. Mill Pond Flume Trail The trailhead for the Mill Pond Flume Trail begins at the west end of the lower parking area. The trail begins by crossing a sturdy footbridge over the canyon at the former dam site, then goes southwest, along what used to be the shoreline. When you reach a fork, take the right trail, which declines gently into the forest. You’ll pass historical markers that include a log cabin and the remnants of a flume that formerly carried water all the way down the mountain to Metaline Falls. Take a moment to sit on one of the wooden benches along the side of the trail and enjoy the deep peace. In the shade of cedar and pine, you’ll hear nothing but the rushing creek and birdsong. The trail eventually intersects the Sullivan Creek Trail; turn left and go back over the bridge to the trailhead. Sullivan Creek Floodplain Trail The Sullivan Creek Floodplain Trail begins at the east end of the lower parking lot. The sign says “Sullivan Creek Trail 565,” but within a few strides you’ll reach a fork. As the sign indicates, bear right for the Floodplain Trail, which gradually descends. At about a third of a mile you’ll reach a junction, where you can go either way; it makes a loop around the flat floodplain. You’ll see groves of young trees, some new saplings, and meadows of wildflowers. Near the west end of the loop you’ll come to a short spur trail that supposedly gives you a view of the former dam site. However, the view is obscured by young trees that are clearly thriving – and after all, that’s the whole idea of restoring this valley.

Apparently when I walked up above the arch, that was the western portion of the Catherine Creek loop. So I did not go on the eastern portion of the Catherine Creek loop. This route took me directly onto the Tracy Hill loop and explains why my hike stats didn’t quite match either of the WTA descriptions! Also, because I just kept going straight, it was quite easy to not go onto the eastern most portion of the Tracy Hill area which goes onto tribal land. ORIGINAL REPORT: My first Columbia River Gorge hike in Washington. Amazing to see so many wildflowers now in April that I don’t usually expect until June. Top three new flowers for me were different types of camas, grass widows (had to go all the way to the top of the loop to see a few still blooming), and shooting stars all over (from half mile or sooner into the hike and to the top)! I did the loop counterclockwise which meant going out over the footbridge on the east side and coming back near the end on the damaged plank bridge, which is opposite of the WTA description. I recorded about 5 miles and 1400ft of total elevation gain. Going this way also means you hike up above the natural arch first and hike back down below it, and that’s when you can see it. So if your main goal is the arch, you’d want to head towards the plank bridge on the west side first. There’s also a smaller loop that can be done, which I think is about 1/3 the size and still includes tons of flowers and the arch. I don’t know how, but somehow in one of the million flowers I was taking a photo of there was a crab spider feasting on a bee (see photo). Well, apparently there were loads of ticks trying to do the same to my dog. I think next time I’ll be coming without him. No issues with poison oak or rattlesnakes though. Parking was easy today.

It was a cloudy day with fog hanging below the Columbia River Gorge rim. We started by hiking below the Catherine Creek Arch on the service road. The vehicle ford still was dry so we didn't have to use the ""trail gnome bridge,"" which is looking pretty decrepit with rotten and broken stringers. We hiked up the east side of Catherine Creek, ascending through the meadows to the rim above Major Creek on what I call East Tracy Hill. We saw several species of native plants sprouting in the burn scars from the fire. Amazingly, Rush Skeletonweed, an invasive species, survived the fire and the upper meadow is filled with its dried plants. After lunch, we traversed over to Tracy Hill proper to check on a large Ponderosa pine overlooking the Catherine Creek canyon that our friend, Bev, long ago dubbed the ""Friendship Tree"" because we have enjoyed many hike lunches over the years in its shade or wind and rain/snow shelter. The ""Friendship Tree's"" offspring were mostly killed in the fire and the tree itself had scaling bark that suggested it might not survive. The fire burned intensely in the deep duff of pine needles and appeared to have scorched the tree roots. We will have to watch it into the future to know its fate. We descended Tracy Hill and took an old ranch road down through the oak woodlands. This route had been overgrown with poison oak in recent years but the fire set it back for at least a short time so the route is accessible again. We closed our loop and returned to the trailhead without seeing anyone all day. PRO TIP: The port-a-potty at the Catherine Creek trailhead has been removed.

And you’ll almost certainly see (and hear) large numbers of geese and other waterbirds. For this hike, drive to the White Bluffs Overlook and head north on a clear game/boot trail. As you walk you’ll have magnificent views up and down the Columbia River, west to the Hanford Nuclear Site, Rattlesnake Mountain and the more distant Cascades, and north to the Saddle Mountains. After about a mile you’ll come to an area of open sand, flat at first, then rising into a nice dune. Continue north over this dune down to a grassy area and on to the next area of open sand. There is no obvious trail, but the route is open and almost entirely on sand, so it’s impossible to lose your way. You’ll almost immediately climb another large dune, then follow a series of lower dunes to a final big dune, a little over three miles from the trailhead. Once past the first area of sand, the bluffs themselves are not especially impressive as they have slumped away in the Wiehl Ranch Landslide complex, a recent landslide (1980s & continuing) caused by loosening of the Ringold sediments by irrigation water seeping from man-made Wahluke Lake and the unlined Wahluke Branch Wasteway. This is an area of hummocky terrain typical of landslides that cries out for exploring. There are numerous easy ways down from the sand and plenty of game trails among the small hills and valleys, sandstone pillars, stands of common reed, and hidden ponds. The dunes above are being formed by the prevailing winds blowing loosened sediments up from the landslide below. Once at the final dune, there are a number of ways to complete your hike. The easiest option is to retrace your steps for an out-&-back hike, but with some planning there are at least two attractive car shuttle hikes. One is to leave a car just south of the Wahluke Branch Wasteway on the road to the trailhead. Your vehicle should be visible from the top of the last dune, so just make your way cross country from the dune back to the road (about one mile). A second option is to leave a vehicle at the trailhead for the White Bluffs North. From the last dune, make your way along the bluffs until you find an easy way down to river level and then walk north to your vehicle. And throughout your hike remember that the cliffs can be unstable, so use caution when near the edge. Hike Description Written by David Hagen, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"We stopped by the Bluffs on our way to pick up our son from Walla Walla University. We missed the turnoff from the main highway because there was no sign at the iron gate, marking the gravel road. A couple flowers were still blooming despite the dry conditions. The weather was nice with clear blue skies, and a slight breeze to cool us as we walked. Highly recommend taking a lot of water or fluids, especially as the temperatures continue to rise as summer progresses. Due to the lack of vegetation for shade, it would be advisable to hike early in the morning when it is cooler (especially if you are taking kids along). The scenery was beautiful.

Return trip was inconsequential as the fire is pretty far above the trail but good for people to be aware. As for the trails, all are in great shape.  Huckleberry is such a pleasant forest walk and this route showcases the diversity of the park, from old growth forest to subalpine meadows to the alpine of the Burroughs. Of note, if you are early like me, prepare to get showered below the knees from morning dew.  Lots of water sources until you get just past Forest Lake.  Some log bridges that are narrow and care should be taken if they are wet.  Not quite the bonanza of berries like I experienced last week but they are still out.  Didn't encounter a single person on this trail on the way in or out.

This hike (10.25 miles/3000 ft.) on a day such as this was one jaw-dropping view after another. The temps stayed in the 40's all day. Great views in the morning, then the clouds. The blue sky was roiled by swiftly moving clouds; just added to the views. Sunrise Road is closed and our contacts with humans was almost zero until on the Glacier Basin Trail on our return to the WRCG. We think CCW is the way to go. After the initial part of the Wonderland, great views abound until back on the GBT. Georg and I started up the Wonderland from the WRCG a little before 8 and arrived back a little before 4. After intersecting with the Sunrise Rim Trail and on our way to the Sunrise Camp we spotted a fox in the meadows just before the camp. Georg had just remarked that he had seen a fox at Sunrise on our hike to Dege same time last year. At the camp we met the only hikers we would see for hours. A couple from North Carolina doing the Northern Loop. They were impressed to say the least. Looking up at the First Burroughs from the camp it looks like quite a hike-only because it is. As I arrived at the top, I was greeted by the trail to Second Burroughs. Georg told me to stop whining and in no time it would be all down hill. I just focused on the Second Burroughs sans people. It was all worth it. We spent close to an hour just soaking in the views and taking advantage of the rock chair. If only it reclined. You can see the lookout, Skyscraper, Tamanos, Mt. Ruth, Dege, a great close up frontal of the Mountain and all its topography. Looking down on all the trails from Frozen Lake, not a person in sight. We did this exact hike 3 years ago and along with Dege and the lookout, we save these for the week from when the Sunrise Rd. closes and the WRCG stays open for a week or so. Great alone type hikes to really some of the best views of the Mountain and its surrounding terrain. They are even better with no people. Our hike from the Second Burroughs to the GBT is rocky, semi-steep with loose sand. At my age I tread very carefully. My rock-hopping days are over. Almost all the way down you are treated to a great view of the Mountain and great fall colors. The views never get old! Looks like we hiked one of the last nice days.

In 1910, research began at Wind River to learn more about reforestation following the Yacolt Fire in 1902. Established in 1912, the Wind River Arboretum is the oldest in the Pacific Northwest and ranks among the earliest forestry experiments still in existence in the region. This interpretive trail passes dead and surviving trees of 250 species from all over the world planted here to see which ones would grow best for timber production. Small placards identify each species; 14 larger interpretive signs tell how the exotic trees fared. It’s no surprise native trees grow best in this climate. If you start your hike on the trail to the left at the arboretum entrance, you will be able to read the interpretive signs in sequence. As you walk through the groves, contemplate the long-term learning that has happened here over the last century. When you leave, look up in awe at the Giant Sequoia trees in front of the historic houses on Chapman Avenue; they have grown very well at Wind River. The low elevation makes this family-friendly hike accessible most of the year, but spring brings wildflowers under the trees. WTA Pro Tip: Some of the former Forest Service houses have been renovated and are available to rent for overnight accommodations. If you’re visiting for the day restrooms are seasonally available at the Hemlock Picnic Area at the junction of Hemlock Road and FR 43.

Trail users who come to experience the Emerald Necklace often utilize the Brevier Road access into the West Trailhead of Antoine Peak. Those wishing for more of a challenge, or at least more elevation gain, should access the trail from the Trentwood Trailhead on the south side of Antoine Peak near Wellesley Rd, since the west trailhead is 620 feet higher in elevation than the Trentwood Trailhead. You'll get more of a workout starting from Trentwood. While traversing the Emerald Necklace loop, the views around the north side of Antoine Peak towards Mount Spokane are some of the best to enjoy. It is important for route finding to know that the Emerald Necklace is completely composed of old logging roads and does not incorporate any singletrack trail. The trail junctions are well marked with wooden posts and reflective trail name signs to assist with route finding. The Emerald necklace does gain and lose elevation while going completely around Antoine Peak. For those interested in Geocaching the south portion of the Emerald Necklace loop has numerous caches. The Emerald necklace is popular with trail runners and offers multiple complementary loops and on/off connections to accommodate athletes seeking various mileage totals for the day.

Pick up an interpretive guidebook and follow the signposts, first right, then back. Trees and shrubs along the river bank were planted in a partnership between the City of Centralia and the Chehalis River Basin Land Trust to protect salmon habitat. As they grow, cottonwood, red-osier dogwood, and willow will restore eroded river banks and create spawning grounds for threatened char. In the meantime, they provide superb bird-watching, including bald eagles, a pair of which resides here year-round. Note, too, the mature black cottonwood forest across the river. The largest such grove remaining along the Chehalis, this ribbon of riparian woodland is protected in perpetuity under a conservation easement. At 1.2 miles, reach the end of the north branch of the route. Note the expansive agricultural fields; they soak up water from the treatment plant and act as a filter before it reaches the river. Follow the path back past the T-junction to the south branch at two miles. Continue on the south branch to its terminus at 2.6 miles, where a thick grove of Douglas-fir and western red cedar towers over a 90-degree bend in the river.

It's great for horseback riders, hikers and trail runners in the summer and snowshoers and cross-country skiers in the winter. Its name comes from a defunct Cold War era site nearby, but signs of that history have long since faded from the landscape. Enter the park and immediately notice the wooden sign with 3 maps outlining the mileages for each loop option: red (5.0 miles), blue (3.5 miles) and green (2.5 miles). Pick your speed and venture forth. Heading straight, the main trail acts as an arterial for the different loops that split off. The sandy two-track is churned up in spots from horses, but it’s easy to find a line on this roomy tread. The ponderosas rise up along the trail, sprinkling the forest floor with a carpet of needles that seems to dampen any noise, making this a quiet, peaceful stroll. Enjoy the little things along the way like the ossified skeleton of a fallen ponderosa or the timeless pleasure of walking up to a crossroads on a country lane and seeing which way your feet will take you. Arrive at the first junction where the red trail splits off to form a horseshoe loop through the northwest reaches of the park. Color-coded signs with arrows at each intersection show the way. Continuing on the main trail, you’ll shortly arrive at a four-way intersection (where the red trail rejoins). The blue and red loops stay straight and share the same clockwise, rectangular route back to the trailhead. For the green loop turn right, passing through patches of shady forest and sun-drenched openings. At the next intersection head right to start your return journey. From here, parallel the eastern park boundary on a trail that covers its distance in a series of gentle ups and downs.

We originally thought we'd go in to Horseshoe Basin via the traditional access at Iron Gate, but I had hiked that trail a few years ago and was hoping for some brand-new-to-me trails to explore. My Hike-a-thon buddy and I put this together last-minute when I was too busy to plan ahead & just knew I wanted to hike in the Pasayten for my long weekend, and he had a last minute change of plans that allowed him to be pulled into my crazy no-plan scheme. I wrapped up trailwork on Thursday & hastily packed my backpack for an early exit on Friday, and fortunately only forgot a couple of items, none critical. We literally pulled over in a park in Tonasket on our way to the Pasayten and spotted ""Cold Spring"" on the map & decided that's where we should start our adventure. My friend reminded me several times that we got lucky that this turned out to be such a good route, so don't try this method of ""planning"" a backpack trip! But we did get very lucky and I would 100% recommend this route, with some caveats noted below. Our overall route was a little over 44 miles in base mileage, plus I added close to 7 bonus miles for fun (off-trail to climb nearby Armstrong Mountain & Arnold Peak + sunset photo wanderings in the evenings). We needed a combination of maps to figure out the trail system here: (1) downloads of various base maps on Gaia, (2) Green Trails Map #21, & (3) photos of the BCHW/DNR trail map kiosks at the trailheads we crossed. Not all of the trails show up on all of the maps, and not all of the trails that show up on the maps still exist on the ground. We even found a couple of unmaintained trails that don't show up on any of those maps. We were a bit confused a few times, but never truly lost or forced to backtrack too far. Cold Spring is both a DNR campground (free with Discover Pass) and trailhead for the Loomis Natural Resources Conservation Area. The campground looked very nice (signs of recent work) and was empty on both Friday when we arrived and Monday when we exited. There's a CXT at the campground, and the trailhead is a few hundred feet farther up the road (no facilities). There were only a few cars at the trailhead here, and I get the impression this area is a little off-the-radar in terms of a good access point to the wilderness. The main route of the PNT comes through this trailhead. On Friday we stayed on the Loomis State Forest side of the trail system, hiking in via the Snowshoe Mountain Trail. The first 3.6 miles are shared with the PNT, but when the PNT headed west at Goodenough Trail, we continued north on the Snowshoe Trail following Snowshoe Creek to Snowshoe Meadows, then continued north on the Border Camp Trail to the US/Canadian border and monument #106. Things to note about day 1 included: On day 2 we spotted Trail #340 on the USGS base map on Gaia, and decided that would be a better option than backtracking to the PNT at Goodenough Trail. We later also noticed that there is another trail labeled #340 on more recent maps, so perhaps this trail has been re-routed or incorporated into other trails on the system now. The USGS version of #340 (or Long Draw Trail on other base maps) climbs west near Snowshoe Meadows and stays fairly far north before joining the modern version of #340 (or Goodenough Trail) near Goodenough Peak. It was mostly bushwhacking through a burn scar, although I spotted old trail tread twice. We did the easy side-hike up to the summit of Goodenough Peak before joining up with the modern Goodenough Trail and finally getting back to beautifully maintained trail all the way to Horseshoe Basin. We hiked into Smith Lake for lunch, but found the campsite there already occupied so backtracked to an open campsite back near the trail junction. After setting up our camp, we did the side hike/scramble up to the summit of Armstrong Mountain, then dropped down to Snehumption Gap, then scrambled up Arnold Peak. After dinner I tacked on two additional miles just strolling up the Boundary Trail and taking photos near sunset. Aside from our morning bushwhack across the USGS version of #340, this was a fairly easy day. On day 3 we started on the easy trails in the main part of the basin, then got into the less popular/less maintained trails as the day progressed. We hiked the Boundary Trail south to the junction with the Windy Peak Trail, and added on the summit spur for the fantastic views before lunch at the trail junction. Then we hiked Clutch Creek #343 to Coulee Creek, which was one of my favorite sections for views and the trailside flora, although it's obvious this trail doesn't see a lot of traffic. There was some downfall but nothing too difficult to negotiate. It was very brushy the farther down the drainage we got, and the ""log crossing"" of Coulee Creek indicated on the Green Trails map is now the site of a failed bridge. It was an easy rock hop across and we took a long break next to the creek before continuing our trek on Deer Park #341, which was in very rough shape but passable, then finally Albert Camp Trail #375. We ended our day at the road intersection, taking advantage of the very cushy campsite offered at the 14-Mile Recreation Site. It's a small USFS campground with two (!) CXT-outhouses, picnic tables, and a lovely creek flowing nearby. We had the entire place to ourselves for Sunday night, and I enjoyed a 20-minute soak in the creek to help my aching knees after a 17+ mile day with both long ascents and descents. Things to note about day 3: On our last day, we started with a short road walk connecting between the 14-Mile Recreation Site to Disappointment TH via FR 3975. Road walks are not my favorite, but this one had lots of ripe berries to distract along the way (raspberries, currants, and gooseberries). Disappointment TH needs a better name to encourage use! There were hardly any vehicle tracks leading to the parking area, which is being overtaken by grass. It's another nice starting location for a hike, with a big parking area and a CXT-outhouse at the TH. We had a bit of a tricky time locating the start of the Johnny Beall Trail at this location since it's another one where the USGS and Green Trails maps don't agree on location (Green Trails has the new re-route, closer to the parking lot than the USGS indicates), and due to lack of use thick grass was obscuring the start. We also missed a turn on the Johnny Beall trail and ended up on the nearby North Fork Trail. It wasn't a big deal to miss the turn, although it did add a few extra miles to our hike and also meant we needed to repeat a short segment of the Snowshoe Mountain Trail that we started the hike on. My friend described the Johnny Beall/North Fork sections as a ""lodgepole luge course."" It looks as though the trail was put in with a mini-excavator, and it's more fall-line than contouring. There's a bit of downfall here and there, but nothing too difficult. And the trail surprisingly comes to several small water crossings with giant trail bridges! This was a Hike-a-Thon mileage booster! Please consider supporting my Hike-a-Thon by clicking here . Stats: Day 1: 10.19 miles via Cold Springs TH, Snowshoe Mountain Trail, Snowshoe Trail, Border Camp Trail to Monument #106 at the international boundary, to our campsite. Day 2: 8.25 miles of real hiking via the historic version of #340 to Goodenough Trail to Horseshoe Basin + Smith Lake. 4.46 bonus miles to Armstrong Mountain & Arnold Peak, & 2.35 bonus miles on the Boundary Trail with the camera. Day 3: 17.52 miles on trails 533, 342, 343, 341, & 375. It would be easy to break this into two days for anyone who doesn't relish the idea of a big mileage day. Day 4: 8.42 miles on FR3975 back to Loomis State Forest, then Johnny Beall to North Fork Trail to Snowshoe Mountain Trail. This would have been several miles shorter save for a missed turn at an unmarked intersection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We began our hike in at around 11am on a drizzly Saturday. We had a permit to camp at Boulder Creek Campground. Travel was easygoing, although the steady incline that begins a few miles in gave a healthy amount of challenge for my first backpack of the year. We took a few minutes to check out the decommissioned ranger station, old gas station and other buildings found a few miles in and stopped again at the Glines Canyon Overlook where the Upper Elwha Dam contained the Lake Mills Reservoir prior to its removal. Note that the bathroom here is locked. There is one river crossing where you will either have to balance on rocks/logs (which I found challenging with my overnight pack) or change into water shoes. No snow was encountered until after the trail turns to dirt in the last couple miles, and was only encountered on trail within a quarter mile or so to the hot springs. I did not select ""no snow"" for this trip description because that's not true, but if there was a level below intermittent I would have selected that. Our stay at the campground was quiet, with only one other tent in the area. We slept in a hammock and it worked great. Pit toilets available open to use but do remember your own toilet paper. There is about a 10 minute walk between Boulder Creek Campground and the hot springs area. We were able to have the hot springs to ourselves. Day hikers had already departed by our late afternoon arrival. In the morning we came back for another soak before heading out on a partly cloudy Sunday, this time beating the arrival of any day hikers. The springs themselves were idyllic.

Cascade Rock is a shorter but steep hike up out of the valley to a high point. While there's no view, it's a beautiful, quiet walk through the forest. Glines Canyon Overlook is a former interpretive site where the Elwha Dam used to stand. It provides a great stopping spot for day hikers, including interpretive signage and a stunning view into the canyon that the dam had blocked for years.

We only saw one other couple on the trail.,,,,922 feet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Swofford Pond The South Swofford Pond Trail is a joint venture by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Cowlitz River Project of Tacoma Power and runs almost two miles around the south side of Swofford Pond to its southwest corner. It is a moderately-graded, mostly wooded trail that offers plenty of opportunities to view wildlife, marvel at old-growth cedars and enjoy glimpses of the surrounding Swofford Valley. The trailhead is just a few hundred feet away from where Riffe Lake is separated from Swofford Pond by a spillway. The 240-acre shallow stocked pond was originally created to rear juvenile steelhead but is now managed for warm water fish. You are more likely to see hopeful fisherman with their poles in the water than other hikers on this ramble around the lake. The wide trail starts off relatively close to the water, walking past tall grass, Fringecup, sword fern and cattails. The alder and hemlock trees are well spaced, leaving plenty of room for sunlight to filter down on the snails and millipedes as they share the path with you. You can also expect that being close to the water here could mean a swampy trail in the wetter months of the year. The trail narrows a bit at a quarter mile in and moves up into the forest but still runs parallel along the water. You will find yourself walking between huge moss covered cedar giants with wood sorrel carpeting the forest floor and you may find yourself looking for leprechauns, although you are more likely to see the local elk munching a snack. Take time to climb a few of those old trees, plenty have good places to kids to take post and listening to birds singing. There are a few small streams to hop over before you reach a sturdy bridge over Sulphur Creek a half mile into your trek. The trail will alternate between decommissioned road and groomed tread, just keep to the right with the contour of the pond. About three-quarters of a mile in, the trail again takes you down closer to the water and you will catch a few views through the tall grass, Indian Plum and maple. There are trail markers that begin here to lead you the rest of the way. The trail continues to be relatively level and there are puncheon bridges and turnpikes to help you over most of the swampy areas. Here the hearty vegetation will most likely crowd the trail, watch out for stinging nettles and salmonberry. Just shy of two miles in, the trail ends and you can step down towards the pond for a view of rowboats floating lazily on the water and the surrounding farmland with the Swofford Valley hillside for a backdrop. It may be possible to continue around further on a fisherman’s trail but it will most likely be overgrown and hard to follow. Go ahead and enjoy the view, then return the way you came. If you are looking to fish or sit right next to the water you would have to go off trail here, the best spots for catching dinner seem to be on the north side of the pond along the road. Hike Description Written by Shannon Leader , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"I love a quiet walk in the woods. This one goes in and out of meadow’s edge and really big trees. The pond is always present. The trail ends at a nice bench to sit and look at the pond. There’s also a short side trail to falls but we did not do that this day. Parking lot is small, with room to park off the street.

This path is wide and flat and is regularly maintained by devoted volunteers. In fact, community partnerships are what make this park so special. The park is owned by a local nonprofit called the Onalaska Alliance, and the lake is stocked with fish and managed by the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife. Over the years, students from the nearby high school and middle school have planted over 1,200 trees along these shores to create a forest that visitors can now wander through. This park has seen big changes since the days when the lake was used as a mill pond for a large timber operation that in turn supported the local economy. Look for plaques around the lake to tell you more about this history.

This makes an excellent outing, whether you want a quick jaunt or a longer bike ride, though the trail is in varying stages of development, so be sure you are prepared for pavement, gravel, or possibly dirt, depending on your route. Access is available for hikers, runners, and bikers from the Pe Ell entrance in Chehalis; or off Dieckman Road, Ceres Hill, or Meskill Road, all near Adna. You can also hop on the trail from Rainbow Falls State Park , where you can ride or walk a short distance from the park's entrance to the trail itself. There are many ways to enjoy this route, here's one: Begin at the Chehalis trailhead. This 5.5 mile paved section stretches from Chehalis to Bunker Creek and sees the most traffic of the trail. Past Bunker Creek, the trail becomes graveled, perfect for bicycles with thick tires. As you walk, keep an eye out for equestrians. In addition to hikers and bikers, horses enjoy this trail from the Adna trailhead, found off Dieckman Road. Equestrians can also access the trail from Pe Ell; a Discover Pass is required for both Adna and Pe Ell trailheads. Though the trail runs 56 miles from Chehalis to South Bend, currently it can only be hiked in sections due to its incomplete nature. Several trestle bridges are closed due to a lack of decking, making them unsafe for travelers. Check out this detailed map of mileposts, closures, and notable sights along the way. Washington State Parks recommends hikers looking for a longer hike access the trail at Adna and hike west for an uninterrupted long hike - more than 12 miles of graveled trail stretch out in front of you from Adna. Making Connections As of December 2015, trestles at Spooner Road and Doty-Dryad Road have opened. This connects more than 12 miles of trail from Spooner Road west of Adna to Pe Ell. In June 2016, three more bridges have opened. While the bridge at mile 27 is still difficult to cross, this recent development allows visitors to enjoy an unbroken 27 miles of gravel, paved, and hard-packed dirt road.

From the parking area at the edge of Camp Caro, walk west across the lawn to access the main trail leading to East/West Pond. The majority of the elevation gain for the hike comes in the first quarter mile as the trail ascends a steep and rocky slope. At the top of the climb, look for the East/West Pond trail junction to the west. The trail intersections are not well marked, so watch for a small spur trail heading slightly south within the next quarter mile. The spur trail takes hikers to the two ponds, which are set back in the forest and are not visible from the main trail. In the spring, East and West Ponds are a haven for water fowl. There is a small viewing platform at East Pond, although the safety railing was damaged and removed due to vandalism (exercise caution if visiting with small children).

Calcite Creek fire in Canada has entered the US and has resulted in a large number of closures listed below (see Figure 4). Closures are in effect for trails in the Pasayten Wilderness due to the Calcite Creek Fire burning in Canada just north of the Pasayten Wilderness Area per the USFS (https://www.fs.usda.gov/alerts/okawen/alerts-notices/?aid=89529). Trails Closed Tuesday, August 6 Fire on SW side of Mt. Adams has led to the closure of FS RD 23 and the PCT in that area.  A larger area on the west and NW sides of Adams are also closed. Sunday, August 4: SR 20 CLOSED Saturday, August 3: SR 20 remains open (pilot car assisted); however, with increased fire intensity and extent, be prepared for closure or long delays ( https://wsdot.com/Travel/Real-time/Map/ ). Please remember to honor (and obey) closures and rules regarding behavior within areas where you are led by a pilot vehicle. Thursday, August 1: SR 20 remains open (pilot car assisted) Cool, moist, cloudy weather enabled fire fighters to fire proof (as much as one can) both the road and the ridge (note the current extent of the fire lines, Figure 1).  The next eight plus days with hot, dry weather will be critical.  Obviously avoiding (by care and by luck) any new fire starts will be critical.  Current fire status in other surrounding fires is shown in Figure 4.  Campground and trail closures all remain in effect. Recommendation: Get the free app, Watch Duty (however, donations are appreciated as it is a non-profit).  It and its associated ‘reporters’ stay on top of almost all of the fires occurring across the west from Washington to California and from Montana to Oklahoma and Texas.  You can turn on and off notifications to specific areas (planning a trip to the Crazy Mountains of Montana, for example) or specific ongoing fires. Friday, July 26: SR 20 is OPEN (as of 1:00 pm)! Thursday, July 25: However, the cooler weather was countered by strong, shifting winds.  Figure 1 is the most recent map with closures provided by the USFS.  Trails to the Maple Pass Loop, Lake Ann, Rainy Lake are all open, however, you must drive to Winthrop/Mazama first to get to both Washington and Rainy Passes (both open).  It is not clear to me why the map shows SR 20 closed over a much greater distance.  WSDoT sources are pretty clear regarding the existence of a closure both ways between MP 148 (Granite Creek crossing) and MP 157 (Easy Pass Trail Head - note, the trail to Easy Pass is CLOSED). Wednesday, July 24: Good news: Cooler weather and fire fighting success have been somewhat effective (see Figure 4). Bad news: SR 20 remains CLOSED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS (see Figure 1). There are additional trail closures associated with the Pincer Two Fire (see Figure 3). Trail Closures associated with the Easy (see Figure 3), Miners (see Figure 2) and Pioneer Fires remain in effect (virtually everything north of Lake Chelan to the Sawtooth Crest). Tuesday: SR 20 Closed between MP 148 (Granite Creek) and MP 157 (Easy Pass Trailhead) Trail Closures (see Figure 3) listed below: CLOSED TRAILS: • PCT #2000 Between Grasshopper Pass and Rainy Pass • West Fork Methow Trail #480 From Trout Creek to PCT Tr. #2000 • Cutthroat Tr. #483 is Closed beyond Cutthroat Lake • Easy Pass Tr. #741 • East Creek Tr. #756 • Boulder Creek Tr. #729 • Mill Creek Tr. # 755 PCT HIKERS: EVACUATIONS could affect access, mail, and resupply in Stehekin PCT hikers are advised to carry extra food to be able to pass through with-out resupplying in Stehekin. The PCT travels for 127.1 miles between Stevens Pass (mile 2467.4) and Rainy Pass (mile 2594.5). Evacuations in the Stehekin Valley may interrupt access to the community from the PCT, mail delivery, and post office access. If you find yourself at High Bridge (mile 2575) on the PCT and access to Stehekin is closed, the nearest road is 18 miles north on the PCT to Highway 20. Saturday, July 20: As a result of the dry lightning storms that occurred on July 17, there were some 1000 ground strikes resulting in a number of fires in Oregon and Washington (see Figure 4 for the North Cascades). New Closures : Nine new fires in Glacier Peak Wilderness area; Pacific Crest Trail closed.  Trails: Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail #2000.2 from Mica Lake to Suiattle Pass, Suiattle River Trail #784, Miners Ridge Trail #785, Buck Creek Pass Trail #789, Miners Cabin Trail #795, Grassy Point Trail #788, and Sulphur Mountain Trail #794.

One mile in on the Tarbell Trail is the beginning of The Silver Shadow Trail. At the end, Silver Shadow reconnects with the Tarbell Trail to make a five-mile day hike that can be done in 3 hours. Heading clockwise on the Tarbell, the trail heads upwards near the top of Kloochman Bluff. At mile 1.1 on the Tarbell is the Silver Shadow Trail. Turn right onto the Silver Shadow Trail. As you hike, you'll descend through a former timber sale via a series of switchbacks to the base of Kloochman where it rejoins the Tarbell Trail.Your way takes you through both open, recovering harvest area, and into gorgeous open forest that is delightfully shaded. Along the way, hikers, bikers, or horse riders are treated to a variety of Douglas-fir forests in various stages of growth, from seedlings to saplings to mature trees. This is the Yacolt Burn State Forest and the Department of Natural Resources harvests trees for timber sales. Fortunately all of this area has been replanted. At the base of the Silver Shadow trail, rejoin the Tarbell Trail.

I didn’t explore it but looks like the new road might go almost to Hidden falls now or very close. The waterfall itself was quite full after all the rain we’ve been getting ♥️,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Yacolt Burn State Forest - Appaloosa Trail This is a connector trail that goes from the west side of the 25-mile Tarbell Trail Loop to the east side and one of the latest of the Department of National Resources (DNR) trail projects in the historic Yacolt Burn State Forest of southwest Washington. As a connector trail, Appaloosa can also be used to make intermediate-length day hikes. The trail begins by crossing Rock Creek on the first of three bridges. A mile further is the confluence of Rock Creek and Coyote Creek and a second creek crossing. From here the trail generally follows the south side of Coyote Creek through a forest, a half mile along a flat, old logging road, then bridges the stream a third time and follows the stream bank. 1.7 miles from the trailhead, the trail surfaces on another logging road. It's steep, but it's just 160 paces before the trail returns to a more forgiving grade through newly planted forest and then into an intermediate growth forest. One more mile of hiking uphill through increasingly mature forest and you're at a junction with the Tarbell trail. Along the way the forest changes from deciduous riparian to a mature coniferous one interspersed with tree plantations in various stages of growth. You could call it a day at the Tarbell junction, but it's just 0.3 miles down a gentle grade to the creek’s origin at Hidden Falls, a lovely spot to stop for a rest on a bench and enjoy the tall, plunging cascade and lush green understory before heading back the way you came. History The first Appaloosa Trail was created by a riding club and informally developed sometime in the last century. Now a new and well-constructed route, the 3-mile revised Appaloosa Trail originates at Rock Creek Campground and wends its way to Hidden Falls. This trail was constructed by the Department of Natural Resources with participation by Backcountry Horsemen, Washington Trails Association, and The Washington Conservation Corps.

Hike Description Written by Multiple authors contributed to this report, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"I love the Yacolt Burn! I went for a run from the Rock Creek campground and did a loop using the Tarbell trail and Appaloosa trail. Be aware that the Appaloosa trail is currently closed during the week for logging operations and a small section of the trail is closed/gone, so you have to hike down the logging road to catch the trail again (maybe a mile?). The trails were in great shape. There were a few downed trees on the Tarbell trail that were easy to navigate around or under. Each tree was right before miles: 1, 3, 5, 7, and maybe 9 (I can't recall for sure on mile 9). The snow started as you got closer to the Tarbell trailhead, but it was mostly on the sides and just slush. This made the trail wet and a bit muddy. It was still easy to run/hike on, but you might get your feet wet! Also, the snow was only in the exposed areas, so very intermittent snow and no more than half an inch to an inch. I love doing this loop and highly recommend it and encourage a short stop at Hidden Falls, which is very lovely now! The loop was just at twelve miles with the detour to Hidden Falls and back. Amenities at Rock Creek Campground: There is a pit toilet at the trail head, which has always been clean and fully stocked with toilet paper.

It commemorates Larry Scott, the conservation steward and co-founder of the Peninsula Trails Coalition who championed the development of the ODT, and the segment is also known as the Larry Scott Trail. From the Milo Curry trailhead, the trail rises gently from the clearing, and after passing some private properties, a ravine descends on the left, a wetland on the right. Ravens and pileated woodpeckers can sometimes be heard. Some domestic animals can be spotted, including many horses (as a sign along the trail warns, don’t feed them fingers — or anything else) in pastures along the trail. Mixed forest and madrona punctuate the pastures, as do the signs of the nearby urban world when the trail briefly runs alongside SR 20. Around mile 3, cross under SR 20 near Jacob Miller Road, where the trail becomes asphalt for a bit before returning you to the forest. In another mile or so, the paper mill on the right signals that you are approaching the waterfront (on some days, the mill’s telltale aroma will greet you before you see it). Shortly, leave the heavy industry behind as the waterfront emerges on the horizon ahead. Check out a helpful pictorial guide to both native and invasive species posted near the western trailhead, courtesy of the Washington Native Plant Society. All trailheads — Port Townsend waterfront, Cape George and Milo Curry — have restrooms. Bring sufficient water as there are no sources on the trail. Toilet Information Toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Wheelchair Accessibility The trail is hard-packed and about 10 feet wide in most places. Wheelchair users should know that grades in excess of 5% run for several hundred feet near the 2- and 4-mile markers. The trail crosses a few low-traffic roads, so no long waits or mad dashes are required, with generally good, consistent signage. Hike Description Written by K.

I hiked the loop counter-clockwise, where the trail initially runs parallel to the road (there is some road noise here). Eventually the loop begins to turn away from the road and passes through a dense conifer and cedar forest. Closer to the marsh, the trees change to majority Ponderosa pine and the forest opens up (with obvious signs of harvest in the somewhat recent past). The trail reaches a major intersection just before the two mile mark, where hikers can choose further exploration on the Pine Ridge Loop or the Riverview Loop.

Fauntleroy park offers some impressively tall trees, both conifers and deciduous trees. There is a good system of short trails, with boardwalks, rustic stairs and viewing platforms. Wildflowers are common in spring, and many wild birds make the park their home. The park encompasses the drainage of Fauntleroy Creek that once was a salmon stream, and there currently are efforts to restore the coho run here. Trails Next Door WTA is working to ensure nature is always within reach. There is no entry fee, and official park hours are daily, 6 a.m. to sunset. There are no trail signs in the park, so you might find it useful to download a park map , with numbered commentary, from the ""Self-Guided Nature Walk"". The commentaries offer information about landscape features, and the plants and animals you might see here. You can, if you like, explore the park on your own with map in hand. Or, if you prefer a more structured hike, a suggested route follows. Head into the park on the obvious trail. Unless you are hiking in winter, the trees and shrubs all will be leafed out and the setting very green. In spring and early summer, be alert for wildflowers such as trillium, fringe cup, youth-on-age, avens, skunk cabbage, miner's lettuce, buttercup, salmonberry, and thimbleberry. In about 750 feet, come to a trail fork. It's worth checking out the left fork that leads to a boardwalk and platform with views of the surrounding terrain. A social trail may continue on from there, but it's best to return to the main trail, where you turn left and cross a rustic bridge. At the next trail fork, head left and continue uphill. Admire the tall trees along the way. Farther along, another trail fork to the left leads out to SW Cambridge Street. You can check out this side trail if you like. Then return to the ongoing trail and continue uphill to reach the southern park entrance along SW 97th Street. When you are ready, head back downhill, rejoin the main trail, and turn left. Continue on, cross a small stream and climb some stairs to reach an overlook. Farther along, you can explore a short loop trail to the left that goes out to an entrance on Forest Court SW. Continue on the trail next to the fence and return to the main trail. It leads to a bridge, and out to a parking lot shared by a church and a YMCA. (This large parking lot is posted prominently for their use only - others risk being towed.) To return to the Barton Street entrance, just follow the sidewalk next to the street uphill for a couple of blocks. HISTORY The park and surrounding community are named for nearby Fauntleroy Cove; while the cove, in turn, was named for Ellinor Fauntleroy by her fiancé, Lieutenant George Davidson, who took soundings in the cove during an 1857 survey. He also named an Olympic peak (Mount Ellinor) in her honor. Toilet Information No toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Hike Description Written by Alan Gibbs , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"I left Burien in the early afternoon and traversed the western edge of West Seattle, reaching the water taxi pier just after sunset on a brisk February day. My route started from home, but this hike could easily start at Westwood Village, which is served by the RapidRide C and H lines. This was a lucky Saturday to walk through White Center, as there was a truck selling fresh scones in the McLendon Hardware parking lot. After a further fuel stop at the Salvadorean Bakery, I headed to the Cambridge St entrance to Roxbury Park. The park proved a beautiful (if occasionally muddy) escape from the concrete, but I got lost as usual in its hilly thatch of trails. This just meant more clean air and forest smells before I stumbled out onto Barton St and made my way to the Fauntleroy ferry terminal. I took the access trail just north of the dock and walked across an idyllic stretch of residential beach before reaching the even more idyllic park. Lincoln Park sported a dazzling array of dogs who had gathered to see and be seen; I almost missed the troll sculpture amidst the furry friends and impending sunset. I departed Lincoln Park onto Beach Dr SW, which took me all the way to Alki Point. The stretch between Lincoln Park and Alki contains several small parks and beach access points where one can enjoy the lapping of Puget Sound away from the crowds at the major West Seattle parks. These afforded me some dazzling prospects of Vashon, Blake, and Bainbridge Island as the sun continued to drop. I then skirted past Alki Point and onto the trail that took me all the way to the West Seattle Water Taxi terminal, with a brief stop at the always surprising public restroom at the Alki Beach Bathhouse. I reached Marination Ma Kai at the water taxi terminal just shy of 13 miles into my hike. I ate a hearty meal while waiting for the next departure. The view from the boat ride across Elliott Bay came up in the clutch as always, and upon landing on the downtown waterfront I was right across Alaskan Way from a RapidRide C and H stop. This turned my one-way hike into a highly convenient loop. The cold temperature kept me from sweating too much and inspired a brisk pace, but I recommend that my fellow winter hikers bring gloves and scarves to thwart the merciless wind blowing in from the sound.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"47.5215 , -122.3851 Map & Directions",

This is a beautiful small lake tucked immediately under Grizzly Peak and the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). Where Heather Lake is often shared with a number of hiking and camping groups, you are pretty much assured to have lunch by yourself at Glasses. Only a half-dozen trip reports have been filed in the last decade, this is a good predictor of solitude. From the east end of Heather Lake, cross the large log jam at the outlet stream, left from the big swimming ledge when looking at the lake from the Heather Lake trail. Once across the logs, proceed along the south shore of the lake, following a well-established fisherman’s trail. You will cross a small stream coming down the valley from the south. This is the outlet stream from Glasses Lake. Look for an old ""no campfires"" sign, as the trail up to Glasses runs right by this sign. The trail tread is faint, as is appropriate for a trail that sees minimal traffic. In addition to the faded tread, the trail is marked with blazes and occasional survey tape. It is not hard to follow. You will climb steadily up and be rewarded when you arrive at the lakes edge. Note: The only way to access Glasses Lake is via Heather Lake, so while it is only 1.5 miles from the larger, more popular lake, a roundtrip hike to Glasses Lake is 10 miles from the trailhead and back. Toilet Information Toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Hike Description Written by Rob Shurtleff , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"On a sweltering Monday, with the high temperature in Leavenworth predicted to be 104, we were looking for a moderate hike through shady forest, with lots of water for our dog along the way. We were camping in busy Lake Wenatchee State Park, and given the crowds there, we anticipated finding lots of hikers at the local trailheads. The hike to Heather Lake not only satisfied our search criteria, it also surprised us with a total lack of other hikers and no overnight campers at the lake. We had the entire basin to ourselves all day. Perhaps, as suggested by the trail description, the area is very popular on weekends, but on this Monday, it was totally deserted. The road to the trailhead is in excellent shape and suitable for all vehicles. HEATHER LAKE The trail up to Heather Lake is also in great shape, with only a couple of recent windfalls across the trail. Most of the streams that cross the trail along the way still had flowing water, so our dog was able to stay hydrated and relatively cool in the heat. Although the trail description mentions that this is a popular trail with families, we thought that the long hike through forest, without any views, combined with the long, steep climb in the second half of the hike, might not be the best option for getting children excited about hiking and backpacking. This is not an easy or particularly exciting hike. We enjoyed a long lunch break on the rocks at the northeast end of Heather Lake, where the official trail ends. The view down the lake is relaxing (see photo) and some lovely camping spots are clustered here. GLASSES LAKE After our lunch break, we set off to find Glasses Lake. Crossing the log jam at the outlet to Heather Lake was easy, and we had no trouble finding the beginning of the use trail along the southeast shore. We followed this faint, overgrown trail all the way to its end at the southeast end of Heather Lake. The trail was at times difficult to discern under the pervasive blanket of huckleberries, and was often blocked and obscured by windfalls across and along the trail. It roughly follows a contour above the lake, providing pee-a-boo lake views but only two possible access points down to the lakeshore. We did find footprints of a previous hiker in one spot, so apparently other hikers are using this trail, but it is clearly not used often. At the end of the lake, the trail ends at a lovely campsite across the outlet of the stream coming down from Grizzly Peak. Here there is access to the lake and a potential fishing spot. On the way to the end of the trail, we had missed the turn-off to Glasses Lake. After some searching, we found it on the way back. It is exactly as described in the trail description: immediately after an old “No Campfires” sign which is quite conspicuous from the trail. There is also an old blaze on a tree to the left of the trail (uphill) just before you come to the sign. Unfortunately, this is more visible from the southern side than it is as you come along the trail from the north. The trail to Glasses Lake heads uphill (southeast), perpendicular to the trail along Heather Lake. It is very difficult to discern at the junction, being almost completely disguised by rampant huckleberry bushes. Throughout its length it is even fainter, more overgrown, and more blocked by deadfalls than the trail along Heather Lake. Without maintenance, it seems unlikely to remain discernable for many more seasons. It is a steep, uphill grind, with several short sections that qualify as scrambles requiring hands as well as feet. Even our game and agile dog required help scaling a couple of these steep sections. We found only one flag and one blaze along the way. The trail is in forest almost all the way. About a quarter mile from Glasses Lake, it tops a small plateau and ambles a short distance through a subalpine clearing, with a lovely stream meandering through. Unfortunately, this idyllic interlude is short-lived. After a couple of hundred yards the trail re-enters the forest and heads abruptly uphill again, through a mass of fallen trunks and branches and up through a steep rock crevasse, before finally topping the ridge and affording a welcome view of Glasses Lake. A few more strides brought us to the lakeshore and the end of the trail (see photo). The lake is lovely, but there is very little access to the weedy shoreline. We managed to find a small, semi-dry spot, just large enough for the two of us to sit and enjoy a welcome break and snack. As far as we could tell, there are no camping spots anywhere between Heather and Glasses Lake, and no place to camp at the latter. OVERALL Throughout most of the day, we had little problem with mosquitoes or flies as long as we kept moving. Biting flies were peskier than mosquitoes, especially around the lakes. An onshore breeze helped keep them at bay during our lunch break at Heather Lake. However, our break at Glasses Lake was cut short by swarms of flies that seemed undeterred by our insect repellent. This is not a wildflower hike. We spotted a few blooms along the way, but mainly the understory is a carpet of huckleberries. Unfortunately, none of these had flowers or berries, even unripe ones. Perhaps it is a bad huckleberry year. Overall, we felt that this had been a good choice for a blistering hot, sunny August day. We loved the total solitude and the adventure of making it up to Glasses Lake. However, compared to many other hikes in the Cascades, I would say the reward for effort of this trail is low, especially if you include the extension to Glasses Lake.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yesterday I combined a walk up Kalaloch Beach from the lodge to the Tree of Life, then up and through the campsite to the Kalaloch Creek Nature Trail loop on the other side of Highway 101 and then back again. Total elevation gain was minimal, maybe 100 feet, with a combined distance of about three miles. The trip up the beach was in sunny weather, but with the ocean mist constantly rolling in. I timed it for when the tide was receding and donned sand shoes for this section, and after checking out the Tree of Life (located on the beach) and reaching the campsite I washed off my feet and put on proper hiking boots. The trailhead to the nature trail wasn't too hard to find, but crossing the highway made me feel like I was Frogger. The trail itself was just a short one-mile loop through a stand of old trees, and most of the big ones were missing their tops. There was one fallen Redwood snag that blocked the trail and had to be clumsily climbed over. Overall it's a pretty trail but I definitely wouldn't bother driving all the way out here just for it.

The wide and wet Kalaloch Nature Trail provides a quiet forested walk on a well-maintained trail, thanks in part to WTA volunteer crews, who visit this area each year to improve sections of this trail, trying to keep the eternal rains of the Peninsula from damaging it too much. From the parking area for the Kalaloch Campground, walk south to campground A. A sign points left (east) indicating the Kalaloch Nature Trail. Straight ahead, a service road continues through a gate. This trail leads to the Kalaloch store and is a convenient connector if you're camping in the park, but for now, take the trail branching left. Walk to the edge of Highway 101 and cross, being sure that there's no oncoming traffic. Remember, this is a US Highway, so cars will be moving very fast. Once safely across, immediately plunge into deep forest. The nature trail here is wide, but the forest all around is all-encompassing. Trees grow huge and gnarled, draped with thick moss. Skunk cabbage blooms early, lighting up the forest floor with its bright yellow leaf and pungent odor. The trail itself can be boggy -- despite WTA efforts, sections remain where puddles do form after periods of heavy rain. Push through these, across a log bridge, and down a set of steps. You'll continue walking among the giants of the forests, on a generally southerly trajectory, before arriving at a viewpoint of Kalaloch Creek. Foliage obscures the best views, but marvel at this large freshwater tributary feeding into the Pacific Ocean before turning back on the trail and heading north, away from the creek and through the forest, back to the trailhead.

This is admittedly a crazy idea as a day hike, but it could easily be transformed into a multi-day backpack trip. We met at the Noisy Creeek TH late in the afternoon on Saturday & dropped off my car. Then we carpooled in my friend's car to the Salmo Loop TH, ate dinner, and slept for a few hours. We knew this route would take more hours then there was daylight available, so we were up & on-trail by 4am on Sunday morning. The route starts by dropping into the Salmo Basin, all of which we experienced by headlamp. Even so, the many mushrooms along the side of the trail were spectacular! I've hiked this trail on numerous previous occasions, but if anyone plans to re-create this route & has not seen the Basin in daylight, don't start so early as the forest is also beautiful. We were within a couple miles of the Shedroof Divide by the time the sun came up, and stopped at the last water source for our first real break of the hike so we could top off water bottles for the long dry section ahead. The fall colors are fantastic in the upper reaches of the Basin trail, and especially along the Shedroof Divide. The larch haven't really started to turn yet, so this one will continue to offer great fall colors until snow prevents access. We didn't need the water break at the camp below Cabinet Pass, but did stop again at the source just before the Salmo Divide junction. There were small water sources available at seeps along the trail near Thunder Mountain, and we stopped for another fill-up just past the junction with Thunder Creek & Jackson Creek. The hike up the steep switchbacks at Helmer was interrupted by several ""tourist stops"" to take in the colors on the burned landscape, all crimson & gold. The fatigue of all the miles started to hit us around Pass Creek Pass, where we stopped for a snack break & had a hard time standing up and walking again! But again, this section was beautiful and all of the fall colors offered a good distraction from sore muscles. Sunset on the Hall-Grassy Divide was spectacular! We didn't really start to suffer from this crazy hike until the sun went down. The lower portion of the trail has experienced several burns in recent years, so my usual landmarks to help me judge distance were impossible to pick out. It really wasn't until the last 7 miles that I struggled, but not enough for me to consider stopping early. We exited the Noisy Creek trail just a little after 9pm. Total distance was 43.16 miles with about 7500' elevation gain. The route is within the Salmo Priest Wilderness from the TH to Pass Creek Pass. A large portion of this route is also a segment of the Pacific Northwest Trail. It's a very easy route to shuttle, and could even be made a little longer by ending at the north end of Sullivan Lake.",,,,"6,229 feet",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Hall - Grassy Divide This long ridge route gives hikers big views in all directions and also serves as a connector to enable big loop opportunities with other nearby trails. Since this trail is not accessible by vehicle as a stand-alone hike, hikers must choose which feeder trail best suits their access needs. There are three different trailheads that grant access to the Hall — Grassy Divide trail, which serves as a connector trail between Noisy Creek and Hall Mountain to the west and Grassy Top trail to the east. For the easiest road access to the Hall — Grassy Divide, start at the Noisy Creek trailhead at the south end of Sullivan Lake, located on the edge of the popular Noisy Creek campground. A small trailhead just off the pavement provides hiker parking for the Noisy Creek trail. This trail ascends 5.3 miles one-way to its intersection with both Hall — Grassy Divide and Hall Mountain Summit trail. Turn east at the junction to continue on the Hall — Grassy Divide. For less overall elevation gain compared to the Noisy Creek trail access, hikers may choose to start their hike at the Johns Creek trailhead for Hall Mountain Trail 540. Please note that Johns Creek is only open to motorized vehicles between July 10-August 14 each summer and is best suited to high-clearance vehicles. The Hall Mountain trail from Johns Creek comes to a junction with both the Hall — Grassy Divide and Noisy Creek Trail after a mere 0.7 miles. Hikers who come from either starting trailhead will want to consider tacking on the additional 1.8 miles one-way to ascend to the summit of Hall Mountain. The third trailhead access for the Hall — Grassy Divide is located at Pass Creek Pass, the start of the trail to Grassy Top . This longer approach via rough Forest Service Road is best for high-clearance vehicles. Start on the Grassy Top trail, which intersects the Hall — Grassy Divide after 2.7 miles (consider continuing 1.1 miles one-way to the summit of Grassy Top before proceeding). The Hall — Grassy Divide itself is about 5 miles one-way, opening up many possibilities for overnight and multi-day trips on the Sullivan Lake Ranger District. The trail crosses through forested areas and also includes wildflower-filled alpine meadows. A portion of the trail has been impacted by two major wildfires in recent years, leading to sections with big views but little shade, and downfall trees may be an obstacle to contend with both early season and following windstorms. The only drawback is that there is no access to water along this trail, so be sure to carry enough to hike through, or plan campsites along the Noisy Creek and Grassy Top feeder trails. Toilet Information No toilet at trailhead More information about toilets Hike Description Written by Holly Weiler, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"I hiked to the Northwest summit of Grassy Top which is right above the Hall-Grassy junction at the 2.7 mile point. The summit requires some bushwhacking the final 300’ gained in about .25 of a mile after leaving the trail but in mostly open forest with huckleberry understory which later give way to meadows. The best approach is to walk for a few hundred yards toward Hall Mtn until reaching a small meadow on the southwest side of the NW Grassy Top summit and walk through forest for a short distance to more open meadows. I had not studied satellite images sufficiently and took a more direct route from the southeast. Though shorter, this route required more bushwhacking and I only noticed the better approach after the fact. The trail has been logged out from Pass Creek Pass and is in good condition other than a few minor brushy areas.

While there was no snow at this elevation, the trail was muddy in many places, which made it difficult to navigate. The trail starts on an old jeep road that lasts less than a quarter of a mile. At this point, there is a swampy mud pit (about 10-20 yards of this). Someone brought planks to make crossing it easier, but we still had difficulty staying out of the mud. Walking around it is difficult because the surrounding blackberry bushes offer nothing to hold. The trail is relatively easy to follow beyond this but is overgrown in many places. At higher elevations, we saw a few cows, basalt formations, and several groves of trees growing along the stream below. We turned around after about 1.75 miles because the trail got extremely precarious with mud and steep slopes. The trail became unclear after the stream crossing where we turned around. We were the only people on the trail, but there was evidence of hunting/other recreation. We saw fresh boot prints and horse prints (as well as horse and cow poop). This trail seems like it would be better in the late spring/early summer after the mud has dried a bit. As it was, it wasn't a bad winter hike, and snow was not an issue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We met our group at 7:30am and caught the trail on the East side of the parking lot. The group was doing an Everesting challenge, seeking to hike up and down a number of times over a long weekend to reach the height of Mt. Everest, in elevation gain.  We only came for Saturday as we had other engagements, AND having already reached over 29k in elevation from prior hikes, felt no pressure to hike up more than once. We have never hiked here so it was a great opportunity to check it out. This hike provides forest, meadows, lakes, wildflowers, wildlife and big mountain views from the top (Mt St Helens, Mt Adams, Goat Rocks, and of course Mt Rainier). Starting temp was in the mid-forties but we warmed quickly as we climbed up hill through the shaded forest.  We crossed a few small streams passed a lake and a couple of small tarns. There are still some wildflowers but mostly past prime.  As we gained elevation and were out of the tree cover things opened up and we were treated to huckleberries, more flowers and 5 playful marmots higher up on the trail. We saw elk tracks and bear scat but no elk or bear were seen.  We did not see any other hikers until we reached the summit where they were off loading from the gondola and hiking downhill. We arrived at the summit in just under 2 hours. ~5 miles, ~2500 eg. The staff was setting up for a wedding next to the gondola platform, and we were informed there was an event that evening ""Summit Fest"". Tickets were apparently sold out, so there was no option for us to attend. Of our group of 7, two showed up shortly after us, 1 took an extended hike (run) up some adjacent ridges to find their way back to the trail and show up 5 or 10 minutes later.  Those 3 took the gondola down to join another group who was starting up at 10:30am.  We stayed at the summit to wait for our 2 remaining hikers who took a more leisurely approach to the trek appearing at the summit 3 hours later. The 3-hour wait at the summit went by quickly. The air was a little chilly at first but the sun was warming things up quickly. There were great views to soak in and decent people watching.  There were quite a few dogs, all well behaved and on leash. 2 Other friends rode the gondola up and joined us to cheer on the final two hikers when they arrived. Once the rest of our crew arrived we took the gondola back to the parking lot, and set out to find something to eat.  Great day, great conditions and great company.

Guessing they all camped in about the same spot. The one comment we heard and have heard before, this is our favorite part of the whole hike, but then, we knew that to be the case. One person from the lake joined us on top and we met one person on the Silver Creek Trail.

The trail up Shoeffler Butte is part of The Mullan Road which was built by the military between 1859 and 1862 under the command of Capt John Mullan and was an early wagon route over the Rocky Mtns to the Pacific Northwest. This section of road south of Lake Coeur d’Alene, completed in 1859, quickly proved impractical because of flooding and bogs in the St. Joe Valley. This portion of road was abandoned in 1862 after a new section over Fourth of July Pass was built, roughly paralleling today’s Interstate 90. Importance of Mullan Road diminished after rail lines were constructed in 1880s. The road was abandoned after completion of an automobile highway in 1916.

These trails are short and well built with rock steps for stable footing. This loop trail system may be started at either the Chelan Hatchery or at the loop’s top just off Highway 150 on the way into Chelan. Parking at the fish hatchery allows for the muscles to get warmed up before tackling the numerous stairs and switchbacks crafted into the hillside. Begin the counterclockwise loop by first walking north through the Chelan Fish Hatchery operated by the Washington Fish and Wildlife Department. Once past the hatchery a wide, level gravel trail is reached. After a short distance you’ll reach a fork in the gravel trail. The Cultus Jim trail is signed and will turn off to the right. At this point the trail becomes a single-track path winding through mature sagebrush steppe. The trail now begins to ascend in earnest up a narrow break in the cliff bands. Expertly laid native rocks make for an easy tread. In season the cliff walls echo with the descending scales of a canyon wren. Spring flowers carpet the hillside. At the top of this climb a brief gravel road walk takes you to the upper parking area. Bearing towards the left at this parking area you will find the Chelan Bob trail, first ascending a bit more, then ultimately descending back to your car. Steep cliffs with magnificent views of the Columbia River, McNeil Canyon and the Waterville Plateau stretch out below. In winter Beebe Springs freezes into a large cascade across these rocks. Pay attention to the main trail as several social paths may lead you astray. Rock steps once again make the trail much less gravelly and easier for the descent. At a junction with the Toad Creek Loop, stay right to return to the hatchery grounds to find your car. (The Toad Creek Loop is a nice shorter, flatter hike option in this same trail network.) Take a moment to consider the hatchery where hundreds of thousands of smolts and frys are reared every year before going into the Columbia River and alpine lakes. The state of Washington has done extensive work in the area, including across highway 97 alongside the river, restoring native plants and wildlife habitat. Though it is hard to get away from the noise and visuals of industry and the highway, there is still a strong influx of migrating birds, a bighorn family, and much other wildlife. Owing to the diverse ecosystems found here (shrub Steppe, riparian, and grasslands) the birding is excellent. Tribute is due to the namesakes of these trails. Chelan Bob and Cultus Jim were members of the Chelan Tribe. In the late nineteenth century these men refused moving to the Colville Reservation and instead took allotments of land offered by the Federal Government through the Dawes Act. These men and their families lived in the lower Chelan Lake area all their lives. Hike Description Written by Austin Smith , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"Beautiful and fun hike! We had a good time with two little kids, who enjoyed climbing the stairs and seeing the big views as we ascended.

The area we practiced in is DNR territory and needs a permit to access, so I'm not sure how useful this trip report will be to most people. We had a little of everything: wind, snow, rain, sun, and lots of blackberry vines tripping people. We arrived in two waves of students and instructors so everyone could have private instruction time and more realistic practice scenarios. Our field trip lasted from 8:30 (first wave) to 3:45 (last wave leaving). The approach road (4-5 miles) is pretty rutted (we carpooled) and entry off Highway 18 is pretty nasty coming from Seattle - I hate blocking traffic and a left hand turn with northbound 18 traffic took at least 10-12 cars. Not an intersection I'll visit again. Once we got started, we had an engaging number of scenarios that gave us practice with map and compass, taking bearings, routefinding through dense forest, inchworming and leapfrogging (perhaps my favorite practice), and then shifting to Gaia use, finally ending with navigation by compass only. Two members in my party of 7 fell and a third almost fell; the co-leader opted out of the bushwhacking half of the day. Kind of a gnarly trip, all things considered, from weather to tech to terrain. But our group was amazing, our instructor stalwart and supportive, and to end the day we had a few sunbreaks. The takeaways were 1) be smart choosing gear, 2) never rely on Gaia if your phone is not the newest version, and 3) old-school map and compass remain the way to go, at least for me. The class didn't convert me! Despite the problems, though, the people made the day, especially my navigation partner who also drove the rutted road. There were no facilities anywhere (thanks, trees!) and nobody else up there except our field trip group.

Starting in the Ponderosa neighborhood in the south Spokane Valley, trail options include the 2.2-mile Flying L trail, which climbs from the parking area and traverses a Ponderosa pine forest before breaking out into an open hillside, flanked along its lower reaches by an old apple orchard and a small year-round stream. Located on the right and just past the stream, the Inside Passage trail junction expands the trail options. Visitors can choose to remain on the Flying L trail, which eventually connects to the main Glenrose Trail, or turn north on the Inside Passage trail leading toward The Cliffs trail (named after the area itself). Since The Cliffs trail also connects to the main Glenrose Trail, it is additionally possible to hike a loop instead of an out-and-back. The The Cliffs trail leading north from the Inside Passage and Glenrose intersection was formerly a lollipop loop with an impressive view overlooking the Spokane Valley, but — due to the recent Dishman Hills Conservancy acquisition of the Keystone Property, purchased in early 2025 — there is now a critical public corridor and trail connection with the Dishman Hills Natural Area. It is important to note that the trail corridor is narrow, with private property located on either side. Please respect adjacent private property owners by staying on trail. Additionally, the natural area is a hiker-only trail system (dogs are permitted on leash, but neither bikes nor horses are permitted within the natural area). The area is perhaps best for its spring wildflower displays, although it is accessible year-round and has something beautiful to offer in all seasons. Additional trails are also on the horizon, as Spokane County Parks recently acquired a private parcel located between the Flying L Ranch and the Cliffs. A new connecting trail is expected by late 2025. WTA worked here in 2020! Hike Description Written by Holly Weiler, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,I love this trail system and everything is so green right now. Fruit trees are budding and the wildflowers are blooming. My group and I set out on the Flying L trail and took it to the Glenrose unit. Hiked the old road/trail to the Inside Passage trail and followed it down to Flying L to make a 4 1/2 mile loop back to trailhead.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were surprisingly a lot of cars in the Gold Creek lot on this rainy day. We parked on the trailer side. The facility was open and stocked, but the door doesn't close all the way. We donned full raingear then headed up the Tin Mine Trail and immediately found mud and water on the trail. That would be the theme today. Up to the connector, there was water running down the trail and erosion down the center. Once we broke out into the open, the rain and wind pelted us, and made us glad we geared up. Climbing was more arduous with pants on and I started getting warm, but the wind kept my overheating in check. Ran across the only person we'd see this day, just before heading back into the trees and downhill. I don't know who was more surprised! The first half the descent to the mine was wet. Water ran down the trail up to 1.5 inches deep, pretty much full-width. At some point the trail relative to the hillside changed and water ran under the trail through culverts. We found the mine entrance and knew we wouldn't be exploring too far in as we didn't feel like digging out headlamps and the footing was sketchy as floating branches littered the way as a means to stay out of the water. Not real functional today. We went in about 15 feet then called it good. By this time the rain had diminished and there was no wind to speak of in this area. Looped around a few little lakes then headed back via Davis Trail, which was a wide flat thoroughfare on the other side of the wetlands area. More wind in this side and evidence of previous blowdowns, but we had no obstacles at all to deal with today. Took the connector back to our side  of the lot - this was the wettest section of trail today. Lots of mud too.

The trails are open to hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders. Logging operations happen occasionally and can cause trail closures or reroutes. A couple different trails leave from this trailhead. You want the one immediately to the left as you drive into the parking area. Start out on this trail (the Gold Creek Trail) for a little under half a mile before coming to the first junction. Stay straight for another tenth of a mile to the second junction. Going left will take you on a journey to the top of Green Mountain . Stay straight to get on the Davis Trail. Once on the Davis Trail you will roughly parallel Gold Creek on a mostly flat route for 1.5 additional miles until the trail ends at a logging road. You can either turn around and head back on the same trail or devise a different route, combining logging roads and other trails in the forest.

It offers sweeping views of the Columbia River and Mount Hood in the distance and a sandy public beach at the east end. You can spend all day walking this combination of sidewalks and paved trails round trip, or t here are numerous access points that allow shorter hikes. The trail is anchored on the east end by Wintler Community Park, a 12.5-acre park with a sandy beach, picnic tables and restrooms open April-October. A $5 parking fee is collected between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Start your hike at the beach or find the trail at the west end of the parking area. From Wintler Park, walk along the edge of a riparian cottonwood forest and in .3 mile, reach the large Tidewater Cove development that includes offices, condominiums and a marina. A short side trip on the marina breakwater leads to views of Mount Hood rising above the Glenn Jackson (I-205) Bridge. In winter, this is a prime birding spot. Beyond Tidewater Cove, the trail goes inland to bypass a wetland. At 1.2 miles, pass the Water Resource s Education Center across the street, which has restrooms, drinking fountains and educational exhibits that are good for kids. Check their website for opening hours and events. The trail then enters 58-acre Marine Park, with picnic tables, playground, flush restrooms open April-October, and drinking fountains. There is no parking fee. Reach 1.5 miles at the park entrance sign. Another side trip is to walk .5 mile down Marine Park Way to the boat launch ($5 parking fee year round) and the Kaiser Viewing Tower. Interpretive exhibits highlight the role of the Kaiser Shipyards during WW II. Return to Marine Park. From Marine Park, the trail continues 1.2 miles on a sidewalk along SE Columbia Way past the industrial Columbia Business Park, former home of the Kaiser Shipyards. Turn south for .2 mile along SE Columbia Shores B lvd. and resume the waterfront trail. Turn left to a dmire the Wendy Rose s tatue which commemorates the women who worked at the Kaiser Shipyards during WW II. Then turn around to continue west past several restaurants. Pass the Princess Ilchee s tatue next to a residential area . In .4 mile (3.5 miles from start), the trail becomes a long boulevard lined with cottonwoods. This is one of the most heavily used segments of trail so stay alert for cyclists, skaters, skateboarders, and other conveyances. In .75 mile, enter 5-acre Fort Vancouver Waterfront Park with benches, picnic tables and viewing platforms. This is a good spot to view the I-5 Bridge. Free parking. Pass a couple of restaurants slated for redevelopment and walk under the I-5 Bridge to t he Captain George Vancouver Monument Plaza which features Jay Rood's 1992 sculpture “Boat of Discovery” and interpretive panels about the European “discovery” of the northwest coast of North America. A t the next intersection, turn left on Columbia Way to visit the new Vancouver Waterfront Park, part of a 35-acre mixed use urban development on a former mill site. T he park includes the iconic cable-stayed Grant Street Pier, which juts 90 feet out over the river, benches, a picnic area, flush toilet restrooms, drinking fountain, a water feature, and a play area with salmon sculptures, sandy upland beach and netclimber. The west end of the trail terminates at Columbia Way. On-street, metered parking and private pay parking lots are available. Alternative Route : From the Captain George Vancouver Monument Plaza, continue walking north along Columbia Street for .25 mile to Esther Short Park established in 1853, the oldest public park in Washington. Check out the Salmon Run Bell Tower with a glockenspiel depicting a Chinook tale and salmon leaping up the side. The park has benches, a water feature, playground with swings, and flush toilet restrooms. Parking spaces around the park are metered with various time limits. This was the original western terminus of the trail prior to development of the Vancouver Waterfront. WTA Pro Tip: The east end of the trail is much less crowded than the west end, especially on summer weekends. Wheelchair Accessibility The entire length of this trail is paved sidewalks with curb cuts. Hike Description Written by Susan Saul, WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"En route to my brother's place in Oregon, Edelman (that's Coach Edelman, as he's my half marathon coach, though he's pretty chill!) and I stayed in downtown Vancouver, WA for a night.  From the clock tower park near the waterfront and our hotel, I jogged about six miles out and back along the Columbia River Renaissance Trail. The first part parallels the river and takes you past the entrance to the grounds of historic Fort Vancouver.  This is where Edelman headed off to see where his grandfather had been stationed in 1926. I continued jogging along the riverfront, reaching some condos and buildings within about 2 miles. This is where one should head straight if you want to stay on the 'trail' as opposed to following the river. (Note: up to this point and also back along waterfront park downtown are the nicest portions of the trail-- at least considering the part I covered today. Supposedly it gets really nice further east.) The riverfront part of the trail ends just east of the condos, so I doubled back there , ran through a large parking lot, and hooked back up to the 'trail.' I'm using quote marks because it's a paved pedestrian lane. I ran a short distance further east, but it was all light industry and totally isolated, and didn't feel like the safest place for a small woman to run alone. So I pulled a u-ey and ran west again, all the way to the beautiful waterfront park complex which is west of the I-5 Bridge. This is a spiffy area that extends about another .75 miles and has several nice viewpoints jutting out over the river. I figure I ran about six miles total, most of which was very pleasant. Recommendation: rather than run along the industrial park,  next time I'll cut over to the Fort Vancouver National Park area, where a number of people were running and where the grounds are quite nice as well as historically interesting--rich Native American history along the Columbia, as well as the Fort . . .all of which is documented in plaques and a little museum on the grounds.

The area hosts several varieties of flora, thanks to its elevation change from the parking area to the summit. The elevation gain from the parking area gives visitors a nice workout, doable in a day or less, and just minutes from Spokane. It's a destination for horseback riding, hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Many trails exist here, but main access is via the parking lot on Belmont Road. Access the conservation area by hiking, biking, or riding along the road from the parking lot. The road is bordered by private property, so stay on the road. After a mile, the Mica Peak Conservation Area, and choose your own adventure. It's also possible to hike from here all the way to nearby Liberty Lake; a rugged 12+ mile one-way hike . When here, look for sub-alpine low brush to fragrant Ponderosa pine forest. Aspen and birch groves also thrive here, making the hill glow gold in the autumn. Visitors can also enjoy views of Spokane Valley and the rolling Palouse. The peak itself is off-limits — the summit is owned by the FAA — but the western slope of the peak still offers 2,000 feet of elevation gain from parking area to high point.

I've always wondered why Roosevelt is so seldom visited, as it's off the extremely popular Snow Lake trail. We wanted to get an early start to beat the crowds, and because I have work tonight. We left the trailhead, making quick time to Snow Lake before heading to Gem Lake. Mount Roosevelt looms over the far end of Snow Lake, creating a stunning reflection. The trail winds around Snow Lake before ascending towards Gem Lake. You're greeted with stunning views of the Alpine Lake Peaks (Thompson, Price, Big Snow, etc.). Five miles in, we reached Gem Lake, and we immediately turned off the main trail and onto the Mount Roosevelt climbers' trail, which heads Southwest. The trail quickly gains 100 feet before flattening out as you walk along the top of a ridge towards Roosevelt. After a quarter mile of this, the trail begins to steepen as you head through trees and brush. The trail here is still relatively easy to navigate, and we didn't have any problems. This changed around 5,400 feet. The trail becomes quite steep and hard to follow as you pass through hemlock and rocky terrain. Don't slip here; once above this section, the trail gets easier as you climb above a rock outcrop before traversing towards the true summit of Mount Roosevelt. If you're on route, you should be right under the summit block at 5,600 feet, and the trail should be heading Southwest. Follow the trail as it steeply ascends through a mini scree field before you get on more solid rock mixed with trees. Overall, this section was fairly easy, some class 2+ stuff with maybe a class 3 move (maybe?). We simply followed the trail, and before we knew it, we were on the summit. Kaleetan and Chair sit right there dominating the skyline. Glacier, Baker, and Ranier, along with all the Alpine Lake and Mountain Loop Peaks, are visible, making the climb well worth it. The descent proved to be quite a bit more difficult than the ascent; we ended up losing the trail more heading down. Still nothing too difficult besides some steep terrain and plenty of tree-repelling. Overall, with ideal conditions (dry everything), this climb is fairly basic. Some steep class 2+ stuff with a few don't fall areas, but nothing that I would consider real Class 3 or 4. We ran into 120 people from Snow Lake to the trailhead, so I would highly recommend doing this climb on a weekday, as I wouldn't want to imagine the traffic on a weekend.

Begin by hiking to Snow Lake. Continue past the camps on the east side of the lake, and at 3.3 miles and 4,100 feet, encounter a junction with signs to Gem Lake (left) and Middle Fork Road (right). Go right, on what is more accurately the Rock Creek Trail. The trail quickly narrows and becomes rockier, while puddles and squishy mudholes may linger even in dry weather. The trail drops steadily and steeply across talus (especially the middle section, often overgrown with a fern ""forest"") and through (real) forest for 3.5 miles and almost 2,400 feet. Along the way is a seldom-seen view of Rock Creek, tumbling down a lengthy rock face after its exit from Snow Lake. At 6.8 miles, arrive at a junction with the Middle Fork Trail (#1003) and take a right. This section of trail follows an old road, gaining less than 150 feet of elevation over the next 3 miles. Water is available at Thunder Creek, 1 mile later at an unnamed creek and at Burntboot Creek. Camping is possible near Thunder Creek at 7.8 miles. There is NO water source on the entire climb once you leave Burntboot Creek. A snowpatch lingers well into August near the top, and there is standing water (not an ideal water source) in Red Pond eventually. Make sure you have plenty of water as you begin your climb, especially on a hot day. The key to successfully completing this hike is finding the faint, unsigned trail that leaves the Middle Fork Trail for Red Pass. 9 miles into your hike, you get to Burntboot Creek. The three-log crossing of Burntboot Creek, which led to the Goldmyer Hot Springs property, washed away several years ago. There is a tree with a sign for ""Burntboot Creek."" The trail follows Burntboot Creek upstream for about 100 ft, then descends to the creek bed. There are multiple faint trails that go further upstream along Burntboot Creek, in the forest.  It meanders along the creek, then drifts away. 400 feet from the Burntboot Creek sign is proof that you are on the right trail: two signs on a tree, one forbidding bicycles (this sign actually fell off the tree and sits at the bottom of the tree) and the other reading ""trail not maintained beyond this point."" Once you are at this tree, the trail is obvious and shortly after starts climbing. It climbs moderately steeply through lovely old-growth forest. It seems like an endless set of switchbacks as you gain 3,500 feet in just over 3 miles. This part of the trail may have blowdowns when not actively maintained. Enjoy the shade for the first 2 miles, then break out into views seldom seen. At 12 miles from the Snow Lake trailhead, crest over a small pass to an intimidating view of the steep chute leading up to Red Pass. This chute is the only way up to Red Pass other than 5th-class rock. When the snow is melted, switchbacks make this an easy ascent. This steep northeast-facing gully is filled with icy snow well into July. Crampons and an ice axe are often necessary to safely ascend to the pass. It's only 200 vertical feet of ascent, but in June or early July, this is more technically difficult than what you would typically find on the standard routes of any of Washington's volcanoes (not counting crevasse crossings). Know conditions before you go, and don't be afraid to turn around if conditions become dangerous. At Red Pass, located at 12.4 miles and 5,337 feet, going right is a spur trail towards Lundin; taking the trail to the left, you follow the ridge for 0.1 mile before descending a rocky trail down to the plateau holding Red Pond. From there, steep switchbacks take you down into the Commonwealth basin. Drop to 3,875 feet, where your next water stop is available, just under 14 miles from your starting point. At 14.3 miles, go right, where a broken sign on a tree reads ""Abandoned."" At 14.5 miles, rock-hop or ford Commonwealth Creek, then cross again on a log bridge at 14.7 miles. At 14.9 miles, take the short side trail to a worthwhile view of a waterfall. Continue down the narrow and brushy trail to connect with the Pacific Crest Trail, then go right the final 100 yards to arrive at the Snoqualmie Pass trailhead. To close the loop, walk pavement downhill to Alpental Road, then right to retrace the driving route to the Alpental parking lot, a total of 1.5 pavement miles.

Hike Description Written by Ken Giesbers , WTA Correspondent",,,,,,,,"I did a loop from Alpental, Snow Lake, Rock Creek trail, Middle fork trail to Burntboot creek, Old PCT to Red Mtn Pass, Red Pond, Commonwealth Basin trail back to Alpental. It was foggy for most of the day, so no Instagram worthy lake pics. Parking: upper lot was almost full at 8:00am on a cloudy / foggy day. Both lots were almost full at 1:30pm. Designated parking spaces are more obvious this year, but it also seems like the total number of available spots is reduced from last year. Get there early on a sunny weekend say. Bathrooms: open, but 5 people in line. Did not use it. Trail to Snow Lake: good shape and snow free on the climb, maybe 15% snow cover remains on the descend to the lake. Not a problem with hiking boots / trail runners. Rock creek trail: a bit overgrown at the top, a lot overgrown in the middle, nice trail lower down. It is narrow and rocky in the upper half, but easy to follow. a few easy to step over rocks and smaller trees down. Given the low use of this trail a log-out can wait until next year when likely additional trees are down. Middle Fork trail to Burntboot creek: typical, 2 small trees down. Biggest challenge is the Thunder creek crossing, but can be rock-hopped at this point. There is no dry crossing of Burntboot creek to Goldmyer at the regular trail crossing location. I did not check if the logjam about 0.1 miles downstream is still there. Old PCT to Red Mtn Pass: The trail start is hard to find if you don't know what to look for. See one of the pics below. There are multiple faint trails that run parallel to Burntboot Creek, on the South side of the Creek, going upstream. It's maybe 0.1 mile where you head away from the Creek and towards the slope of the mountain. There is an old wooden sign on a tree that says: trail not maintained, and a metal ""no bikes"" sign. (Not sure who in their right mind would attempt a 4000 ft climb on an unmaintained trail with a bike....) Shortly after that sign the trail starts to climb. It's a 4000 ft climb with NO stream crossing. Make sure you fill your bottles at Burntboot Creek. There is usually a snow patch near the top until late summer, but that's still 3700 ft of climbing with no water. The trail is in the best shape I've seen it in the last 10 years, at least. Someone(s) did a LOT of work on this trail. Most of the blowdowns are removed, it is better brushed out than I have seen it in many years, and several hundred feet of treadwork was done. It appears that most of the log removal was done with an ax, and some with a hand saw. At one point they chipped through a 3 ft log with an ax! Very impressive. Thank you to whoever did that!!! And thank you for not bringing a chain saw into the wilderness. Now the warning: I brought an ice ax and microspikes. Big mistake. Should have brought crampons! The last 200 ft of ascent to Red Mtn Pass are an icy, steep snow covered wide gully. I ended up spending a lot of time scratching hundreds of footholds into the snow / ice. The shaft of my ax would often only go 4"" in. It's a long run-out into a rock field if you end up sliding down.... About half way up I was able to scramble up in the moat between the rock face and the snow for a bit, and eventually get to a point where I could climb out off the snow on a mix of rock, moss and some shrubs. I'd call that route a class 4 scramble. So if you do this trail in the next 4 weeks, bring crampons. Should be ok without by August. Once melted out, there is a switchback boot path all the way to the top. (As a reference, 2 weeks ago I climbed Eldorado in just trail runners and never felt the need to put my crampons on.) Red Mtn looked completely melted out (I did not go to the top), though there were still some snow patches near Red pond. The rest of the descend was uneventful and the trail back to the Alpental road is in good shape.","47.4454 , -121.4235 Map & Directions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The trail wraps around the base of Columbia Mountain, passing through pine forest, aspen groves and even a section of aromatic sagebrush. A variant of the hike will take you around a loop trail around the summit of the mountain. There is water available at springs at approximately 2 miles into the hike, but bring a filter as the springs are used by cattle. Camping is available at both the trailhead and at the summit. The lookout has been restored and is open to the public for camping, but no fires or cook stoves are allowed inside or near the structure. The summit stands at 6,760 feet and has great views to the south and west. Wildflowers abound in the summit meadow in the spring and summer. Hike Description Written by Artie McRae, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"Summary:  Highly recommend this trail for Western Larches & views.  There was 2 to 3 inches of fresh snow which really made for great photo opportunities.  The Western Larches are so tall that had to remember to occasionally look up! A few of the larches are starting to lose their needles so recommend you go soon if you have energy for one more Larch hike. You could see smoke from the perscribed burn in the distance.  However, could only occasionally smell the smoke.  There were clouds in the valley the entire day. We only encountered one other hiker on this trail which is more than typical for hikes we've done in the region. Trail Condition:  There were a few minor blowdowns on the main trail that were easy to walk over. On the loop section,    there was one major obstacle that required us to remove our packs to get under. Road / Parking:  The trail starts from a large parking lot near Sherman Pass.  The Pass (Highway 20) was in excellent shape.  The parking lot was not plowed but had only 2 or 3 inches of snow.

We only saw one solo backpacker and a group of 2 people and 4 horses. The trail is within the 2006 Tripod Complex fire zone for the majority of the hike (essentially anything on trail that is south of Sunny Pass). The trails are sun-exposed and dusty, but in good condition and easy to follow. There were several large blowdowns with established paths around them, and just a couple blowdowns that required stepping over. For a Pasayten Wilderness trail that previously burned, the trail is very well-maintained. No matter which direction you approach Horseshoe Basin from, you will need to pass through large burn areas.

Early breaks in the tree cover will give you a taste of some of the spectacular scenery ahead. Keep an eye out for Horseshoe Mountain and Pick Peak to the north, and Windy Peak to the northwest. This loop will take you between the former and over the latter in the next 14 miles. Continue straight through a four-way intersection of the Boundary Trail and Clutch and Deer Park trails. As you observe the surrounding landscape, take note of the natural recovery of the ecosystem after the Tripod fire of 2006. From this point forward, the entire loop fell within that fire’s perimeter. Follow the Boundary Trail to Sunny Pass, where you will then head west on the Windy Peak Trail. From the pass, you will enjoy views of Rock Mountain and Armstrong Mountain to the north, where the Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail passes through on its way from the Rockies to the Pacific coast. Continue southwest on Windy Peak Trail staying to the left at the next two intersections with Basin Creek and Windy Creek Trails. Not far beyond the second intersection, a spur trail to the summit of Windy Peak climbs 200 feet for 360 degree views of the Pasayten. Take great care not to trip on your jaw at the top! Once off the summit, continue south on Windy Peak Trail to Clutch Trail, which you may remember from the beginning of the hike. Take the Clutch Creek Trail east to complete the loop at the first junction that you crossed, then head south on the Boundary Trail, back to the parking area. Hike Description Written by Jeff Kish, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"Spent 5 nights in the wilderness last week for high buck and it did not disappoint! This is an epic loop with incredible diversity. It was misty turning to rain on Sunday as we headed in, the approach to sunny pass was still beautiful with decent visibility. Full parking lot and lots of camps with blaze orange set up along the way. On Monday after the thick morning fog cleared we got epic views the rest of the trip, and surprisingly mild nights. No bugs to speak of the whole time! We stayed three nights overlooking Horseshoe basin and then camped another two nights near the valley bottom of Windy Peak. Spooked a moose Thursday night on the way back to camp. Some of the snowshoe hares are starting to get their white ears and feet but it felt almost summery still. There was surprisingly plenty of flowing water everywhere from the approach up to Sunny Pass almost all the way up to the Windy Peak saddle. Friday morning we started climbing and got to the Windy Peak/Topaz Mtn saddle at around 9 am. It's totally different country once you get on the other side, switched from classic timber and meadowy alpine to alpine desert vibes in a short distance. Views up there are unreal, grateful we got up there on a clear day, just a little smoke hazing up the furthest peaks. There was surprisingly a chance or two for water as you head down from Windy on the drier side as well. Worst part of the trip was definitely the end of the Clutch Creek trail. You pop out in some aspen after what already feels like a long descent and see that you will have to go to the valley bottom and then back up to your current elevation to get to the trailhead. The very long supposedly-half-mile and 600' of vertical at the end was absolutely brutal for us. If I were to do it again I would definitely not climb up to Windy from the valley bottom and head out on the same day, but would have stayed up at Windy one night. Trails were all in good shape though, minimal blowdown given the remoteness and distance we covered. Clutch Creek is a little grassy in places but not hard to follow.

At the pass I could not for the life of me find the Boulder Creek trail or where it heads west down into the valley.  I searched around back and forth and could see no hints even subtle of a trail.  No matter, I figured I'd just follow the route that the trail takes on my map and I'll run into it sooner or later, right?  I bushwhacked down the steep valley headwall, through dense rhododendron thickets and wet slippery blueberry slopes.  Not fun.  No trail.  At the creek at 5400' I looked around and eventually found what seemed to be a nice and well graded trail that took me several hundred feet downhill to a flat meadow area at 4800'.  I was now 800' below where the route appears on the maps, and I was worried I was on the wrong trail.  I lost the trail in the grassy meadow, and wary of the canyon that appeared downstream, I figured it best to regain all the elevation I lost and try to find the real trail higher up.  800' up steep slopes and I made it to where the trail was supposed to be.  Nothing.  Not even animal paths.  So I continued on, traversing north on the west side of Majestic Mountain trying to follow the trail as it appeared on the map.  Thus began the gully section.  My goodness, there were a lot of gullies.  None were trivial, many were cliffy, most had dense slide alder thickets, and the endless sidehilling between was beginning to get to me.  One of these gullies had a trickle which was thankful since I had just about run out of water.  I began to worry that I wouldn't make it back by dark. I kept pushing on, aware of the progressing day and running on adrenaline and cortisol.  As the gullies ended and the route rounded a prominent ridgeline I contemplated heading directly downslope to meet up with the Chancellor Trail, but I was close enough to the North American Mine and I must be able to pick up the trail there, right?  I made it to the mine, found the deteriorating and moss-covered remnants and I could still find no trail.  So I headed downhill from there, cutting through mapped switchbacks several times and each time there was no hint of a trail.  Finally, as the sun was setting I made it, at last, to the Chancellor Trail.  I looked around and not 20 feet from where I landed was a sign for the Boulder Creek Trail, and a very pleasant-looking path leading up through the forest.  Did I really just parallel a perfectly nice trail for 5 miles over some of the worst cross country travel imaginable?  Seemingly so! Lessons: 1) The Boulder Creek Trail DOES NOT follow the line that it appears on all available maps. 2) It is much easier to find the trail from Chancellor than from Boulder Creek Pass.  Try to find an accurate track before attempting from the top. I made my way down the 5 miles on the delightfully trail-like Chancellor Trail and arrived at the trailhead after dark. 16 miles, 6700', 12 hours",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all it came to 46 miles with 16k' ascent and 13k' descent. Lots of hobbling the following day. Trail notes: Cabin Creek remains the most challenging section of travel and  navigation for this route. The 7 mile section between 4th of July trail and Hatchery Creek trail has not been maintained for many years. In the 2.5 miles descending into and climbing out of Cabin Creek the trail is damaged, obscured and/or missing. That said, there is a surprising amount of the old trail that is quite usable. Below I will link to a CalTopo map with some details of this section [spoiler alert: avoid link to preserve the adventure]. I do think that this section would be easier going east to west because if you lose the trail climbing towards Hatchery Creek, you can wander on sandy, open, grassy slopes till you find it again. If you lose the trail climbing towards 4th of July, you could be bush whacking for a long, long time. I've covered the sections from Hatchery Creek to Lake Edna and from Lake Edna to Chain Lakes in prior reports this summer and don't have much to add there. After Cabin Creek, subsequent trails are dreamy.  https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report-2020-06-28-5260820773 https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report-2020-07-25-2040055056 https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/trip-reports/trip_report-2020-08-03-4377773493 Water Notes: Refilling water was crucial for the day. Between the start of Icicle Ridge and Cabin Creek there are no major streams. Powers Creek on Icicle Ridge is still providing good flow. There is a small stream/spring between 4th of July and Cabin Creek at 5680' that is still flowing. After Lake Augusta there is ample flowing water. Maybe the driest stretch is between Frosty Pass and Doelle Lakes. There are a couple small streams close to Frosty Pass, then nothing until Doughgod Meadows. Hope this helps someone to rediscover this gem. Let me know if I can help. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hiking Icicle Divide: Stevens Pass to Fourth of July This is a super-challenging trek that requires extra pre-planning and likely some route-finding experience, but promises a rugged, gorgeous few days in the landscape south and east of Stevens Pass. You will need to arrange a key exchange or a pickup/dropoff before your trip — it's is a one-way outing that leaves Stevens Pass and wanders along Icicle Ridge into the town of Leavenworth. Along the way, you'll pass beautiful lakes and views of deep backcountry mountains. The route is strenuous, with almost-constant elevation gain and loss, and in places the trail can be quite hard to follow. But those with route-finding experience and the drive to plan a technically (and logistically) challenging trip will be rewarded with stunning scenery and views. From Stevens Pass, start off hiking south on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). You're heading towards Florence Lake and the high country past the Stevens Pass Ski Area. Pass Lake Susan Jane and 4.5 miles from the trailhead, arrive at a junction with the Icicle Creek Trail. Here, you'll make a left onto Icicle Creek Trail, passing Josephine Lake (a lovely dayhike option out of Stevens Pass). Descend to a junction with the Chain Lakes Trail and turn left, crossing Icicle Creek (brr!) and soon arrive at the first of the Chain Lakes. Here the real trail gets tricky to follow — look for the one that crosses the second lake's outlet stream and traverses up to a pass at 6300 feet. On the other side of the pass are Doelle Lakes. The route traverses clockwise to the outlet stream of upper Doelle Lake and descends to the lower lake, 12 miles from the trailhead at Stevens Pass. Doelle makes a nice camping spot for the night. To continue on, cross the outlet stream of lower Doelle Lake and follow the very faint Icicle Ridge Trail, heading for Frosty Pass which is 3 miles away. This section of the route is very faint and can be difficult to follow -- be sure to have a map and be able to read it. A boot path descents toward a large meadow. Stick to the left of the meadow, and climb to the top of Icicle Ridge, crossing over it to Frosty Pass. Icicle Ridge trail intersects with the Frosty-Wildhorse Trail at the pass; stay on Icicle Ridge, heading south-southeast. The trail traverses about Lakes Mary and Margaret, treating you to unbelievable views of the central Cascades and the Stuart Range. A camp at Florence Lake (accessed via a side trail) makes for a good night spot, though it's only 5 miles from Doelle Lakes. From Florence Lake, return to the main trail and head to Ladies Pass. Icicle Ridge intersects with another trail, Chiwaukum Creek -- once again, stay on Icicle Ridge. The trail crosses slopes that hold snow late into the season. Be comfortable with snow safety measures if you're hiking here in late spring and early summer. The trail dips to tiny Lake Edna, vanishing at the lakeshore and then reappears as it descends again to cross Index Creek. After all that elevation loss (2200 feet), you get to make it all back up! Arrive at the junction with Index Creek Trail, and once again, stay on the Icicle Ridge Trail and start climbing back up to a saddle at 6700 feet. Whew. Now that the physical challenge of the day is over, it's time for the mental challenge: the trail vanishes here again. You'll need to make your way to the swampy pond named Carter Lake, stay right at a ""junction"" with the Painter Creek trail, and begin climbing (again) to a soaring pass (7,200 feet) on Big Jim Mountain. Lake Augusta lies below -- a good spot to camp after a rough day. The trail undulates from Lake Augusta to a junction with Hatchery Creek trail. Stick to Icicle Ridge (to the right) and descend on hard-to-follow tread until it begins to switchback to the Cabin Creek valley floor. once you arrive at the floor it's a tough bushwhack through slide alder and then a crossing of Cabin Creek. Don't be surprised if you lose the trail here, too. Navigate through marshy forest for a short distance, refill on water, then start climbing back uphill. It's 1800 feet of elevation to reach the top of Icicle Ridge and another junction with the Fourth of July Creek Trail. For a change of pace, get off the Icicle Ridge hike and turn left onto Fourth of July Creek. The descent on the ridge is a knee-buckler after such a long hike. Take your time and enjoy the views from the ridge (one of the benefits of hiking through a former burn area, which is what most of this section of the trail is). You're almost there -- it's a switchbacking descent to the Icicle Ridge trailhead and the end of your hike. WTA Pro Tip: There are a lot of camping options and a lot of ways to do this hike. Consult a map and strategize what your days might look like on this trek well before getting started on trail. Hike Description Written by Multiple authors contributed to this report, WTA Community",,,,,,,,"We picked the trail up from the Icicle Creek trailhead and made our way up to a frosty pass. We did a car drop between the Icicle Creek and Fourth of July trailhead. The French Creek crossing was knee deep, but manageable with poles and a change of shoes. The bridge was collapsed at Icicle Creek, but passable (kinda sketchy to cross but pretty wide). Getting up to a Frosty Pass was pretty clear, a few sections of overgrown bushes but we ran into some volunteers clearing the downed trees. The views between Frosty Pass and Lake Edna were stunning. The trail was easy to follow, but clearly not used too much. The mosquitoes were quiet the annoyance between Lake Margret and Lake Edna. We camped at Upper Florence Lake which was spectacular. After the Chatter Creek turn off, the trail became difficult to find and navigate. Download maps. Have patience. And watch your footing. It was slow hiking making sure we were on track and working through the vegetation. The bushwhacking and route finding was challenging at times and the bugs relentless. Once we got to the ridge before Lake Augusta, the trail become more identifiable and the views returned. I can’t imagine how beautiful this would be in fall with all the larches. Setup camp at Lake Augusta without issues. After Lake Augusta, the trail continues up to the ridge. It splits off there so be sure to turn off on the unmaintained trail for Icicle ridge. The faint trail follows the ridge for a bit and then sharply turns downhill towards Cabin Creek. This was the real mental challenge. The trail was essentially non existent. We saw the occasional footprint but was really difficult to find. I think we were very lucky to see footprints and disturbed grass, such that someone had gone through the area recently. Wildflowers were in full bloom, but the beauty was hard to take in with the swarms of mosquitoes. Once we got to Cabin Creek, we were bushwhacking and pushing through large sections of willows. My pack was constantly getting stuck by branches and my hat pulled off. At the creek crossing I have never filtered water so fast in my life, the swarms of mosquitoes were intense. But after this point filter water every chance you get because it’s pretty dry after this and the 1800 foot climb doesn’t sound like a lot but it’s steep uphill with no trail and a lot of blowdowns. The climb up from Cabin Creek was brutal. Flags on treesg started to appear but route finding was still very challenging. The flags were our saving grace. Read the trail description carefully and make sure you have maps downloaded and are on track. Once you get through the burned area in the trees, the route finding gets easier with the consistent flagging and signs of trail work. The path starts to reappear more consistently. There are one or two streams as you approach the ridge, these are the last sources of water. The views of the Enchantments return on the ridge and it’s a very peaceful hike. On the ridge we saw two mountain bikers, which almost brought me to tears knowing the bushwhacking was finally over. No notes other than dry and no water sources. The turn off towards Fourth of July Trailhead was apparent and the trail was well established down. The sun exposure was brutal as most of this area had burned, the the views and wildflowers were beautiful. Our poor dog was struggling with the heat on his pads, the trail is sand and bare dirt. Shade was limited but we took breaks in it every chance we got. All and all, quiet the adventure and we learned a lot, but will never be back. If I were to do it again, I would head down to the Chatter Creek Trailhead instead of Fourth of July to avoid the bushwhacking and get the best views.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
