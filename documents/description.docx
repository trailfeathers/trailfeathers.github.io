TrailFeathers – Project Overview

Project Summary

TrailFeathers is a web-based outdoor trip planning application designed to help users organize personal gear and collaboratively plan outdoor trips. The system combines structured relational data (PostgreSQL) with AI-generated summaries to support safe, efficient, and well-coordinated adventures.

The primary goal of TrailFeathers is to eliminate redundant gear packing, centralize trip planning, and provide relevant location intelligence (trip reports and conditions) within a single integrated platform.


Core Problem

Outdoor trip planning is currently fragmented across multiple tools:

- Gear is tracked manually or in spreadsheets.
- Trips are coordinated through text messages or shared documents.
- Trip reports and weather data must be manually searched and interpreted.
- Groups often duplicate shared gear (e.g., multiple tents or stoves).

There is no unified system that:

- Stores personal gear inventories.
- Allows collaborative trip planning.
- Prevents redundant packing.
- Integrates summarized location intelligence.

TrailFeathers addresses this gap.


System Architecture Overview

TrailFeathers consists of:

Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)
- User login and registration
- Inventory management interface
- Trip management interface
- Dashboard and collaborative views

Backend (Flask + psycopg2)
- Session-based authentication
- REST API endpoints
- Business logic for trips and gear
- Database integration

Database (Neon PostgreSQL)
- Users table
- Gear table (per user)
- Trips table
- Trip collaborators (many-to-many)
- Optional trip gear assignment

AI Integration (planned component)
- Scrapes recent trip reports
- Summarizes trail conditions
- Generates trip-specific safety insights


Core Features

1. User Authentication
- Users can create accounts and log in.
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.
- Sessions are maintained using Flask sessions.

2. Gear Inventory Management

Each user can:
- Add gear items.
- Store attributes (type, name, weight, brand, condition).
- View their personal inventory.
- Edit or remove gear (future enhancement).

All gear items are tied to a specific user via foreign key relationships.

3. Trip Creation and Management

Users can:
- Create trips with attributes:
  - Trip name
  - Trail/location
  - Activity type
  - Intended start date
- View trips they created or collaborate on.
- Add collaborators to trips.

Trips support many-to-many relationships through a join table.

4. Collaborative Planning
- Multiple users can belong to the same trip.
- The system can later support gear assignment to prevent duplication.
- Designed to scale toward intelligent gear distribution logic.

5. AI-Powered Location Intelligence (Planned)

For each saved trip:
- The system retrieves trail/location name.
- Scrapes recent trip reports.
- Uses AI to generate:
  - Condition summaries
  - Hazard warnings
  - Recommended preparation notes

This reduces manual research effort.


Database Design Philosophy

TrailFeathers uses a relational PostgreSQL database structured around:

- Primary Keys (unique identifiers per table)
- Foreign Keys (relationships between users, trips, and gear)
- Many-to-many relationships for collaboration

This ensures:
- Data integrity
- Efficient querying
- Clean expansion for future features


Technology Stack

- Python (Flask)
- PostgreSQL (Neon cloud database)
- psycopg2 (database driver)
- Flask-Bcrypt (password hashing)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- Planned AI API integration


Design Principles

TrailFeathers is designed to be:
- Simple in architecture
- Modular in structure
- Relationally consistent
- Expandable for AI and automation
- Collaboration-first

The system prioritizes clean data modeling before advanced features.


Current Development Status

- Database schema implemented in Neon.
- Backend API for authentication completed.
- Gear and trip endpoints implemented.
- Local testing environment operational.
- AI integration under development.


Long-Term Vision

Future enhancements may include:
- Automated gear duplication detection.
- Gear assignment optimization.
- Weather API integration.
- Map-based trip visualization.
- Mobile responsiveness.
- Production deployment via Render.
